Inheritance is more commonly thought of as an attribute of object-oriented programming languages rather than databases, but Postgres is technically an ORDBMS or object-relational database management system. So you can have a table cities with columns name and population, and a table capitals which inherits the definition of cities but adds an of_country column only relevant, of course, for capital cities. If you SELECT from cities, you get rows from capitals -- they're cities too! You can of course SELECT name FROM ONLY cities to exclude the capitals. This is something of a niche feature, but when you have the right use case it really shines.

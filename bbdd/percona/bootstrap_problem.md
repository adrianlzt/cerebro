Q: For automatic cluster starting, should it be ok to have in [mysqld_safe] the following: wsrep_urls=gcomm://IP1:4567,gcomm://IP2:4567,gcomm://IP3:4567,gcomm://
A: This will work for automatic cluster starting, but unfortunately it can lead to inconsistency in case of a network split. If a network split happens and a node decides to shut down, and somehow restarts because of this automatic process, it gets bootstrapped because of this option, and you can end up having 2 different clusters serving data to different groups of clients. So, the last gcomm:// option should be avoided. Although it can be helpful when you are testing certain scenarios, donâ€™t forget to remove it before going to production.

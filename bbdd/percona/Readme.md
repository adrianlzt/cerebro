MySQL replication: Availability y Partitioning tolerance


CAP:
	C - Consistency (all your data is consistent on all nodes)
	A - Availability (your system is AVAILABLE to handle requests in case of failure of one or several nodes)
	P - Partitioning tolerance (in case of inter-node connection failure, each node is still available to handle requests)

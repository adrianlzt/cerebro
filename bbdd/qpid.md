Messaging built on AMQP
Apache Qpid™ makes messaging tools that speak AMQP and support many languages and platforms.

AMQP is an open internet protocol for reliably sending and receiving messages. It makes it possible for everyone to build a diverse, coherent messaging ecosystem.

Openstack va a migrar de qpid a rabiitmq en la versión Icehouse por los problemas que da qpid.

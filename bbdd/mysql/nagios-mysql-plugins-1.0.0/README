Currently there is a problem with very long MySQL error log files when
the check_errorlog_mysql.pl script is run the first time.

You will get a [service check time out] from Nagios.

We think about skipping the first scan or similar ways to circumwent. But
have not decided yet about.

Further there is a potential problem when too many error messages were
found...

Your opinion is appreciated!

Distributed Systems Tracing with Zipkin

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that we created to help us gather timing data for all the disparate services involved in managing a request to the Twitter API. As an analogy, think of it as a performance profiler, like Firebug, but tailored for a website backend instead of a browser. In short, it makes Twitter faster. Today weâ€™re open sourcing Zipkin under the APLv2 license to share a useful piece of our infrastructure with the open source community and gather feedback.

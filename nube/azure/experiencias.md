I respectfully disagree. I have worked on two projects with Azure both with big accounts, one even so big that we had senior Azure people sitting in our teams. Both had the highest possible support contract.
Yet their support didn't ever solve a problem within their SLA's and sometimes critical level tickets were hanging for months.

Plus my impression is that whereas AWS (and possibly Google) clouds are built by engineers using best practices and logic, Azure products felt always very much marketing driven e.g. marketing gave engineering a list of features to launch and engineering did the minimum effort possible to have the corresponding box ticked. I absolutely hated working on Azure and now won't accept any contract on it.

Documentation is horrible or non-existing, things just don't work, have weird limitations or transient deployment errors, super weird architectural and implementation choices + you never escape the clunkyness of the MS legacy with for example AD.

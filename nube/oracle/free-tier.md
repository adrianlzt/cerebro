Recommend upgrading to Pay As You Go (PAYG) for the best experience. With PAYG, you'll continue to enjoy all the free benefits without any additional cost, but you'll also receive priority for launching instances and are less likely to face "Out of host capacity" errors. Additionally, PAYG unlocks more types of OCI resources, including free Kubernetes-related infrastructure if that's something you're interested in. It's important to set up budget alerts as a safety net and be mindful of the resources you deploy and their associated costs. This way, you can take full advantage of PAYG while keeping your spending in check.

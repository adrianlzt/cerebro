Your free usage does not roll over from month to month; it's a use-it-or-lose it model. To maximize your benefit from the free usage tier, be sure to spend time each month with AWS, checking out all the services you’re curious about.

For some services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon SimpleDB, Amazon tracks your hourly usage. The free usage tier model provides a number of free usage hours per month for these services. For example, the free usage tier pricing model provides 750 usage hours of an Amazon EC2 micro instance per month. (An instance is considered to be running from the time you launch it until the time you terminate it.) You can run one instance continuously for a month, or ten micro instances for 75 hours a month. How you spend your free usage is up to you.

In some cases, leaving your resources running can actually maximize your free-tier usage. For example, if you run an EC2 instance for only a portion of an hour, AWS counts that as an entire hour against your free usage tier usage allotment. If you stop and start an EC2 instance three times in an hour, you’ll have used up three hours of your free-tier allotment.

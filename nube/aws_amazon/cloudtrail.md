AWS CloudTrail records AWS API calls made for your account via the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and higher-level AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation. CloudTrail delivers log files of this activity to an Amazon S3 bucket. These logs provide you with a history of API activity in your account that can enable security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing.

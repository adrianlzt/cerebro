With Amazon Redshift you can now choose to have your cluster continuously backed up to a second AWS Region by enabling Cross-Region Snapshots. After enabling this feature, all your automated and manual snapshots will be copied to the second region in the background, automatically. You specify a retention period for automated snapshots in the second region; manual snapshots will be retained until you explicitly delete them. Cross-Region Snapshots provide you with an easy way to restore your cluster with recent data, in another region.

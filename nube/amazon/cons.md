Did not account for increased latency after moving to EC2. In the datacenter they had submillisecond access between machines so it was possible to make a 1000 calls to memache for one page load. Not so on EC2. Memcache access times increased 10x to a millisecond which made their old approach unusable. Fix was to batch calls to memcache so a large number of gets are in one request.

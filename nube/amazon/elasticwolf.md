Interfaz gráfica para AWS
ElasticWolf is a client-side application for managing Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud resources with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. This project was inspired by an older tool called ElasticFox (and it also uses the Mozilla cross-platform graphical framework), but has no code in common. ElasticWolf adds many new features, including support for the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, much better VPC support, and a host of other enhancements.

Parece que necesita firefox.
En chrome parece que también funciona, pero no he sido capaz de instalarlo.

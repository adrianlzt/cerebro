The most powerful set of tools available to create your Windows installation experience

https://wiki.gnome.org/msitools
msitools is a set of programs to inspect and build Windows Installer (.MSI) files. It is based on libmsi, a portable library to read and write .MSI files. libmsi in turn is a port of (and a subset of) Wine's implementation of the Windows Installer.
msitools plans to be a solution for packaging and deployment of cross-compiled Windows applications.

This script creates five monitor mode interfaces, four are used as APs and the fifth is used for airodump-ng. To make things easier, rather than having five windows all this is done in a screen session which allows you to switch between screens to see what is going on. All sessions are labelled so you know which is which.



Intenta arrancar varios devices monitor repitiendo el comando:
airmon-ng start wlan0

A mi eso solo me crea una interfaz de monitorizacion

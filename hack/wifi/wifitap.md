Wifitap is a proof of concept for communication over WiFi networks using traffic injection.

Wifitap allows any application do send and receive IP packets using 802.11 traffic capture and injection over a WiFi network simply configuring wj0, which means :

setting an IP address consistent with target network address range
routing desired traffic through it

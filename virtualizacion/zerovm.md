http://zerovm.org/wiki/The_Cloud_Hypervisor

ZeroVM is an open-source lightweight virtualization platform, based on the Google Native Client project. It offers three major benefits:
Speed: The fastest virtual servers in the market today take at least 2 minutes to create. ZeroVM takes less than 5 milliseconds, or about 1/20000th of that time. This huge speedup makes it possible to separate every single task into its own container.
Isolation: ZeroVM is the first hypervisor to isolate each individual user of an application. Old fashioned hypervisors require sharing of one virtual server between multiple users, making app development much harder.
Efficiency: ZeroVM only virtualizes the server parts that do the actual work. Existing clouds are giant server farms that are spending precious resources virtualizing unneeded things.

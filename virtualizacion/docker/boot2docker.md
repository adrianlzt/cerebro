boot2docker is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Tiny Core Linux made specifically to run Docker containers. It runs completely from RAM, weighs ~23MB and boots in ~5-6s (YMMV).


Why not CoreOS?

I got asked that question a lot, so I thought I should put it here once and for all. I liked the original idea of CoreOS: the smallest possible way to boot to docker. Unfortunately CoreOS has been growing larger and just did too many things for me. I just wanted the fastest way to boot to Docker.

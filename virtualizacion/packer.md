Packer is an open source tool for creating machine images, such as AMIs, VirtualBox images, Vagrant boxes, etc. Packer uses a single portable input format – a template – to generate the images for multiple platforms in parallel, so you can create identical AMIs, VMware machines, etc. all at once. This unlocks a lot of interesting use cases.

Do not follow this guide if:

You've done it many many times before. It's all just the same.
You want Ubuntu or SLES. These are not currently supported on Stacki 5.0.
You want CentOS/RHEL 6.x - not supported yet. (Really? 7.x beckons.)

(If you really, really, really...really, need 2 or 3, use Stacki-4.0.

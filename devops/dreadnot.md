Dreadnot is a 'one click' deploy tool written in Node.js.

Dreadnot was heavily inspired by Etsy's Deployinator.

In Dreadnot there is the concept of a Stack, a series of tasks to deploy a specific piece of software.  The Stack defines how a deployment works and what code is being deployed.  For example, in Cloud Monitoring we have one stack for our monitoring pollers and another for our API services.

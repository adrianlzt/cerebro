CFEngine manages the full life-cycle of your IT infrastructure. It has a powerful language and tools to define the desired state of your infrastructure, whether a single server or a complex, global network with many thousands servers, storage and network devices. Powerful agent technology then ensures that this state is continuously maintained.  And the CFDB and Mission Portal help you verify and report on compliance with the defined state.

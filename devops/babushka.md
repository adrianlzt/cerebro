TEST-DRIVEN SYSADMIN.

When you spend time researching something new, it’s pretty easy to forget what you found. That means next time, you have to re-research it again.

A lot of the tech jobs we do manually aren’t challenging or fun, but they’re quite particular and have to be done just right – they’re chores. Things that are important to do, but that are better automated than done manually.

That’s what babushka is for. Once you describe a job using its DSL, babushka can not only accomplish each part of the job, but also check if each part is already satisfied. For each component of the job, a test, along with the code to make that test pass – test-driven sysadmin.

The CodeBlocks Arduino development environment includes a free Arduino simulator, still under development but functional.

Simuino simulates the Arduino Uno and Mega pins - not a pretty-looking realistic simulator, but it works.

The Python based Arduino Simulator is another option, that plays well with the official IDE

Virtronics Simulator for Arduino looks promising, but I don't see why I would pay $14.99 for it, when I could buy one or more actual Arduino clones for that price -> windows y 18$

virtualbreadboard -> windows

In general, CHIP is powered by a 5-volt source like a USB port or phone charger, and draws about 500mA peak (at boot time), runs on around 200mA, and rests with around 80mA with the processor totally unloaded. To make sure you have enough headroom, we recommend that you use a 5v power supply with 2 Amps current available (you could go as low as 900mA, but you risk brown-outs). This may be more than you need to know if you just want to plug it in to the wall, but, as you build projects with CHIP, you’ll be happy to know there’s a lot of ways to get the electricity flowing.


Peak: 0.5*5 = 2.5W
Media: 0.2*5 = 1W
Bajo: 0.08*5 = 0.4W


# Consumo (max, media, min)
Estimando consumo teniendo en cuenta la potencia requerida por CHIP.
Habría que sumar el consumo del cargador

24h: 60Wh  /  24Wh  / 9.6Wh

Mes: 1800Wh  /  720Wh  /  288Wh

Mes estimación, 0.1 * 1800 + 0.1 * 288 + 0.8 * 720 = 0.784kWh
0.784kWh * 0.1449 = 0.11€/mes


# Problemas
Conectado al usb del portatil y con una memoria USB se me apagaba a veces

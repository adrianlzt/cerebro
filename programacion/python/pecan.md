Welcome to Pecan, a lean Python web framework inspired by CherryPy, TurboGears, and Pylons. 

Pecan was created to fill a void in the Python web-framework world â€“ a very lightweight framework that provides object-dispatch style routing. Pecan does not aim to be a "full stack" framework, and therefore includes no out of the box support for things like sessions or databases. Pecan instead focuses on HTTP itself.

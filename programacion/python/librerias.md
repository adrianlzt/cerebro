Ruby on Rails/JavaScript for web development, except for an occasional date with Django or Flask (Python frameworks);
Python (NumPy/SciPy) for numerical computing;
Python (Neurosynth, NiPy etc.) for neuroimaging data analysis;
Python (NumPy/SciPy/pandas/statsmodels) for statistical analysis;
Python (MatPlotLib) for plotting and visualization, except for web-based visualizations (JavaScript/d3.js);
Python (scikit-learn) for machine learning;

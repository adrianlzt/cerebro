The approach that tools like Shiv and PEX take is to leverage Python's built-in support for running zip files. Essentially, if there is a zip file containing a __main__.py file and you execute python file.zip (or have a zip file with a #!/usr/bin/env python shebang), Python can load modules in that zip file and execute an application within. Pretty cool!


XAR is a pretty cool offering from Facebook. XAR files are executables that contain SquashFS filesystems. Upon running the executable, SquashFS filesystems are created. For Python applications, the XAR contains a copy of the Python interpreter and all your Python modules. At run-time, these files are extracted to SquashFS filesystems and the Python interpreter is executed. If you squint hard enough, it is kind of like a pre-packaged, executable virtualenv which also contains the Python interpreter.

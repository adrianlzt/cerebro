DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ttmmuuxx is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, ac‐
     cessed, and controlled from a single screen.  ttmmuuxx may be detached from a screen and
     continue running in the background, then later reattached.

     When ttmmuuxx is started it creates a new _s_e_s_s_i_o_n with a single _w_i_n_d_o_w and displays it on
     screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows information on the current ses‐
     sion and is used to enter interactive commands.

     A session is a single collection of _p_s_e_u_d_o _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s under the management of ttmmuuxx.  Each
     session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window occupies the entire screen and
     may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the
     pty(4) manual page documents the technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of
     ttmmuuxx instances may connect to the same session, and any number of windows may be present
     in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, ttmmuuxx exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1)
     connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  ttmmuuxx may
     be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In ttmmuuxx, a session is displayed on screen by a _c_l_i_e_n_t and all sessions are managed by a
     single _s_e_r_v_e_r.  The server and each client are separate processes which communicate
     through a socket in _/_t_m_p.

     The options are as follows:

     --22            Force ttmmuuxx to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.  This is equiva‐
                   lent to --TT _2_5_6.

     --CC            Start in control mode (see the _C_O_N_T_R_O_L _M_O_D_E section).  Given twice (--CCCC)
                   disables echo.

     --cc _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   Execute _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d using the default shell.  If necessary, the ttmmuuxx
                   server will be started to retrieve the ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll option.  This option
                   is for compatibility with sh(1) when ttmmuuxx is used as a login shell.

     --DD            Do not start the ttmmuuxx server as a daemon.  This also turns the eexxiitt--eemmppttyy
                   option off.  With --DD, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d may not be specified.

     --ff _f_i_l_e       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, ttmmuuxx loads the
                   system configuration file from _/_e_t_c_/_t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f, if present, then looks for
                   a user configuration file at _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f.

                   The configuration file is a set of ttmmuuxx commands which are executed in se‐
                   quence when the server is first started.  ttmmuuxx loads configuration files
                   once when the server process has started.  The ssoouurrccee--ffiillee command may be
                   used to load a file later.

                   ttmmuuxx shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in the
                   first session created, and continues to process the rest of the configura‐
                   tion file.

     --LL _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_n_a_m_e
                   ttmmuuxx stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or _/_t_m_p if
                   it is unset.  The default socket is named _d_e_f_a_u_l_t.  This option allows a
                   different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent ttmmuuxx
                   servers to be run.  Unlike --SS a full path is not necessary: the sockets
                   are all created in a directory _t_m_u_x_-_U_I_D under the directory given by
                   TMUX_TMPDIR or in _/_t_m_p.  The _t_m_u_x_-_U_I_D directory is created by ttmmuuxx and
                   must not be world readable, writable or executable.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to
                   the ttmmuuxx server process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any
                   parent directories are missing).

     --ll            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for
                   compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

     --NN            Do not start the server even if the command would normally do so (for ex‐
                   ample nneeww--sseessssiioonn or ssttaarrtt--sseerrvveerr).

     --SS _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_p_a_t_h
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If --SS is specified,
                   the default socket directory is not used and any --LL flag is ignored.

     --uu            Write UTF-8 output to the terminal even if the first environment variable
                   of LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG that is set does not contain "UTF-8" or
                   "UTF8".  This is equivalent to --TT _U_T_F_-_8.

     --TT _f_e_a_t_u_r_e_s   Set terminal features for the client.  This is a comma-separated list of
                   features.  See the tteerrmmiinnaall--ffeeaattuurreess option.

     --vv            Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into
                   _t_m_u_x_-_c_l_i_e_n_t_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g and _t_m_u_x_-_s_e_r_v_e_r_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g files in the current direc‐
                   tory, where _P_I_D is the PID of the server or client process.  If --vv is
                   specified twice, an additional _t_m_u_x_-_o_u_t_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g file is generated with a
                   copy of everything ttmmuuxx writes to the terminal.

                   The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the ttmmuuxx server process to toggle log‐
                   ging between on (as if --vv was given) and off.

     --VV            Report the ttmmuuxx version.

     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_f_l_a_g_s]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control ttmmuuxx, as described
                   in the following sections.  If no commands are specified, the nneeww--sseessssiioonn

     ttmmuuxx may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix
     key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.

     The default command key bindings are:

           C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
           C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.

     ttmmuuxx supports a large number of commands which can be used to control its behaviour.
     Each command is named and can accept zero or more flags and arguments.  They may be
     bound to a key with the bbiinndd--kkeeyy command or run from the shell prompt, a shell script, a
     configuration file or the command prompt.  For example, the same sseett--ooppttiioonn command run
     from the shell prompt, from _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f and bound to a key may look like:

           $ tmux set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

           set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

           bind-key C set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

     Here, the command name is ‘set-option’, ‘--gg’ is a flag and ‘status-style’ and ‘bg=cyan’
     are arguments.

     ttmmuuxx distinguishes between command parsing and execution.  In order to execute a com‐
     mand, ttmmuuxx needs it to be split up into its name and arguments.  This is command pars‐
     ing.  If a command is run from the shell, the shell parses it; from inside ttmmuuxx or from
     a configuration file, ttmmuuxx does.  Examples of when ttmmuuxx parses commands are:

           --   in a configuration file;

           --   typed at the command prompt (see ccoommmmaanndd--pprroommpptt);

           --   given to bbiinndd--kkeeyy;

           --   passed as arguments to iiff--sshheellll or ccoonnffiirrmm--bbeeffoorree.

     To execute commands, each client has a ‘command queue’.  A global command queue not at‐
     tached to any client is used on startup for configuration files like _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f.
     Parsed commands added to the queue are executed in order.  Some commands, like iiff--sshheellll
     and ccoonnffiirrmm--bbeeffoorree, parse their argument to create a new command which is inserted imme‐
     diately after themselves.  This means that arguments can be parsed twice or more - once
     when the parent command (such as iiff--sshheellll) is parsed and again when it parses and exe‐
     cutes its command.  Commands like iiff--sshheellll, rruunn--sshheellll and ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess stop execution
     of subsequent commands on the queue until something happens - iiff--sshheellll and rruunn--sshheellll un‐
     til a shell command finishes and ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess until a key is pressed.  For example, the
     following commands:

           new-session; new-window
           if-shell "true" "split-window"
           kill-session

     Will execute nneeww--sseessssiioonn, nneeww--wwiinnddooww, iiff--sshheellll, the shell command true(1), sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww
     and kkiillll--sseessssiioonn in that order.

     The _C_O_M_M_A_N_D_S section lists the ttmmuuxx commands and their arguments.

PPAARRSSIINNGG SSYYNNTTAAXX
     This section describes the syntax of commands parsed by ttmmuuxx, for example in a configu‐
     ration file or at the command prompt.  Note that when commands are entered into the
     shell, they are parsed by the shell - see for example ksh(1) or csh(1).

     Each command is terminated by a newline or a semicolon (;).  Commands separated by semi‐
     colons together form a ‘command sequence’ - if a command in the sequence encounters an
     error, no subsequent commands are executed.

     It is recommended that a semicolon used as a command separator should be written as an
     individual token, for example from sh(1):

           $ tmux neww \; splitw

     Or:

           $ tmux neww ';' splitw

     Or from the tmux command prompt:

           neww ; splitw

     However, a trailing semicolon is also interpreted as a command separator, for example in
     these sh(1) commands:

           $ tmux neww\\; splitw

     Or:

           $ tmux 'neww;' splitw

     As in these examples, when running tmux from the shell extra care must be taken to prop‐
     erly quote semicolons:

           1.   Semicolons that should be interpreted as a command separator should be es‐
                caped according to the shell conventions.  For sh(1) this typically means
                quoted (such as ‘neww ';' splitw’) or escaped (such as ‘neww \\\\; splitw’).

           2.   Individual semicolons or trailing semicolons that should be interpreted as
                arguments should be escaped twice: once according to the shell conventions
                and a second time for ttmmuuxx; for example:

                      $ tmux neww 'foo\\;' bar
                      $ tmux neww foo\\\\; bar

           3.   Semicolons that are not individual tokens or trailing another token should
                only be escaped once according to shell conventions; for example:

                      $ tmux neww 'foo-;-bar'
                      $ tmux neww foo-\\;-bar

     Comments are marked by the unquoted # character - any remaining text after a comment is
     ignored until the end of the line.

     If the last character of a line is \, the line is joined with the following line (the \
     and the newline are completely removed).  This is called line continuation and applies
     both inside and outside quoted strings and in comments, but not inside braces.

     Command arguments may be specified as strings surrounded by single (') quotes, double
     quotes (") or braces ({}).  This is required when the argument contains any special
     character.  Single and double quoted strings cannot span multiple lines except with line
     continuation.  Braces can span multiple lines.

     Outside of quotes and inside double quotes, these replacements are performed:

           --   Environment variables preceded by $ are replaced with their value from the
               global environment (see the _G_L_O_B_A_L _A_N_D _S_E_S_S_I_O_N _E_N_V_I_R_O_N_M_E_N_T section).

           --   A leading ~ or ~user is expanded to the home directory of the current or spec‐
               ified user.

           --   \uXXXX or \uXXXXXXXX is replaced by the Unicode codepoint corresponding to the
               given four or eight digit hexadecimal number.

           --   When preceded (escaped) by a \, the following characters are replaced: \e by
               the escape character; \r by a carriage return; \n by a newline; and \t by a
               tab.

           --   \ooo is replaced by a character of the octal value ooo.  Three octal digits
               are required, for example \001.  The largest valid character is \377.

           --   Any other characters preceded by \ are replaced by themselves (that is, the \
               is removed) and are not treated as having any special meaning - so for example
               \; will not mark a command sequence and \$ will not expand an environment
               variable.

     Braces are parsed as a configuration file (so conditions such as ‘%if’ are processed)
     and then converted into a string.  They are designed to avoid the need for additional
     escaping when passing a group of ttmmuuxx commands as an argument (for example to iiff--sshheellll).
     These two examples produce an identical command - note that no escaping is needed when
     using {}:

           if-shell true {
               display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }$foo'
           }

           if-shell true "display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }\$foo'"

     Braces may be enclosed inside braces, for example:

           bind x if-shell "true" {
               if-shell "true" {
                   display "true!"
               }
           }

     Environment variables may be set by using the syntax ‘name=value’, for example
     ‘HOME=/home/user’.  Variables set during parsing are added to the global environment.  A
     hidden variable may be set with ‘%hidden’, for example:

           %hidden MYVAR=42

     Hidden variables are not passed to the environment of processes created by tmux.  See
     the _G_L_O_B_A_L _A_N_D _S_E_S_S_I_O_N _E_N_V_I_R_O_N_M_E_N_T section.

     Commands may be parsed conditionally by surrounding them with ‘%if’, ‘%elif’, ‘%else’
     and ‘%endif’.  The argument to ‘%if’ and ‘%elif’ is expanded as a format (see _F_O_R_M_A_T_S)
     and if it evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent text is ignored until the clos‐
     ing ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ or ‘%endif’.  For example:

           %if "#{==:#{host},myhost}"
           set -g status-style bg=red
           %elif "#{==:#{host},myotherhost}"
           set -g status-style bg=green
           %else
           set -g status-style bg=blue
           %endif

     Will change the status line to red if running on ‘myhost’, green if running on
     ‘myotherhost’, or blue if running on another host.  Conditionals may be given on one
     line, for example:

           %if #{==:#{host},myhost} set -g status-style bg=red %endif

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     This section describes the commands supported by ttmmuuxx.  Most commands accept the op‐
     tional --tt (and sometimes --ss) argument with one of _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n,
     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w, or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e.  These specify the client, session, window or pane which
     a command should affect.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t should be the name of the client, typically the pty(4) file to which the
     client is connected, for example either of _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_p_1 or _t_t_y_p_1 for the client attached
     to _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_p_1.  If no client is specified, ttmmuuxx attempts to work out the client cur‐
     rently in use; if that fails, an error is reported.  Clients may be listed with the
     lliisstt--cclliieennttss command.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n is tried as, in order:

           1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

           2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss command).

           3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session named
                ‘mysession’.

           4.   An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

     If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so
     ‘=mysess’ will only match exactly ‘mysess’, not ‘mysession’).

     If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches produce
     an error.  If a session is omitted, the current session is used if available; if no cur‐
     rent session is available, the most recently used is chosen.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w (or _s_r_c_-_w_i_n_d_o_w or _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w) specifies a window in the form
     _s_e_s_s_i_o_n:_w_i_n_d_o_w.  _s_e_s_s_i_o_n follows the same rules as for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n, and _w_i_n_d_o_w is
     looked for in order as:

           1.   A special token, listed below.

           2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in session ‘mysession’.

           3.   A window ID, such as @1.

           4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

           5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

           6.   As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name.

     Like sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name specifies
     the next unused index if appropriate (for example the nneeww--wwiinnddooww and lliinnkk--wwiinnddooww com‐
     mands) otherwise the current window in _s_e_s_s_i_o_n is chosen.

     The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has a
     single-character alternative form.

     TTookkeenn              MMeeaanniinngg
     {start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
     {end}         $    The highest-numbered window
     {last}        !    The last (previously current) window
     {next}        +    The next window by number
     {previous}    -    The previous window by number

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e (or _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e or _d_s_t_-_p_a_n_e) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to
     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w but with the optional addition of a period followed by a pane index or
     pane ID, for example: ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the cur‐
     rently active pane in the specified window is used.  The following special tokens are
     available for the pane index:

     TTookkeenn                  MMeeaanniinngg
     {last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
     {next}            +    The next pane by number
     {previous}        -    The previous pane by number
     {top}                  The top pane
     {bottom}               The bottom pane
     {left}                 The leftmost pane
     {right}                The rightmost pane
     {top-left}             The top-left pane
     {top-right}            The top-right pane
     {bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
     {bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
     {up-of}                The pane above the active pane
     {down-of}              The pane below the active pane
     {left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
     {right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane

     The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

           select-window -t:+2

     In addition, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e may consist entirely of the
     token ‘{mouse}’ (alternative form ‘=’) to specify the session, window or pane where the
     most recent mouse event occurred (see the _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T section) or ‘{marked}’ (alterna‐
     tive form ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see sseelleecctt--ppaannee --mm).

     Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are prefixed
     with a ‘$’, windows with a ‘@’, and panes with a ‘%’.  These are unique and are un‐
     changed for the life of the session, window or pane in the ttmmuuxx server.  The pane ID is
     passed to the child process of the pane in the TMUX_PANE environment variable.  IDs may
     be displayed using the ‘session_id’, ‘window_id’, or ‘pane_id’ formats (see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S
     section) and the ddiissppllaayy--mmeessssaaggee, lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss, lliisstt--wwiinnddoowwss or lliisstt--ppaanneess commands.

     _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d arguments are sh(1) commands.  This may be a single argument passed to the
     shell, for example:

           new-window 'vi ~/.tmux.conf'

     Will run:

           /bin/sh -c 'vi ~/.tmux.conf'

     Additionally, the nneeww--wwiinnddooww, nneeww--sseessssiioonn, sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww, rreessppaawwnn--wwiinnddooww and rreessppaawwnn--ppaannee
     commands allow _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d to be given as multiple arguments and executed directly
     (without ‘sh -c’).  This can avoid issues with shell quoting.  For example:

           $ tmux new-window vi ~/.tmux.conf

     Will run vi(1) directly without invoking the shell.

     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s] refers to a ttmmuuxx command, either passed with the command and argu‐
     ments separately, for example:

           bind-key F1 set-option status off

     Or passed as a single string argument in _._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f, for example:

           bind-key F1 { set-option status off }

     Example ttmmuuxx commands include:

           refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

           rename-session -tfirst newname

           set-option -wt:0 monitor-activity on

           new-window ; split-window -d

           bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
                   display-message "source-file done"

     Or from sh(1):

           $ tmux kill-window -t :1

           $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

           $ tmux new-session -d 'vi ~/.tmux.conf' \; split-window -d \; attach

CCLLIIEENNTTSS AANNDD SSEESSSSIIOONNSS
     The ttmmuuxx server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients are attached to
     sessions to interact with them, either when they are created with the nneeww--sseessssiioonn com‐
     mand, or later with the aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn command.  Each session has one or more windows
     _l_i_n_k_e_d into it.  Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or
     more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.  Commands for creating, linking
     and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the _W_I_N_D_O_W_S _A_N_D _P_A_N_E_S section.

     The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

     aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn [--ddEErrxx] [--cc _w_o_r_k_i_n_g_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y] [--ff _f_l_a_g_s] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: aattttaacchh)
             If run from outside ttmmuuxx, create a new client in the current terminal and attach
             it to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  If used from inside, switch the current client.  If --dd is
             specified, any other clients attached to the session are detached.  If --xx is
             given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client as well as detaching the
             client, typically causing it to exit.  --ff sets a comma-separated list of client
             flags.  The flags are:

             active-pane
                     the client has an independent active pane

             ignore-size
                     the client does not affect the size of other clients

             no-output
                     the client does not receive pane output in control mode

             pause-after=seconds
                     output is paused once the pane is _s_e_c_o_n_d_s behind in control mode

             read-only
                     the client is read-only

             wait-exit
                     wait for an empty line input before exiting in control mode

             A leading ‘!’ turns a flag off if the client is already attached.  --rr is an
             alias for --ff _r_e_a_d_-_o_n_l_y_,_i_g_n_o_r_e_-_s_i_z_e.  When a client is read-only, only keys bound
             to the ddeettaacchh--cclliieenntt or sswwiittcchh--cclliieenntt commands have any effect.  A client with
             the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_p_a_n_e flag allows the active pane to be selected independently of the
             window's active pane used by clients without the flag.  This only affects the
             cursor position and commands issued from the client; other features such as
             hooks and styles continue to use the window's active pane.

             If no server is started, aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn will attempt to start it; this will fail
             unless sessions are created in the configuration file.

             The _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n rules for aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn are slightly adjusted: if ttmmuuxx needs
             to select the most recently used session, it will prefer the most recently used
             _u_n_a_t_t_a_c_h_e_d session.

             --cc will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to
             _w_o_r_k_i_n_g_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

             If --EE is used, the uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt option will not be applied.

     ddeettaacchh--cclliieenntt [--aaPP] [--EE _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d] [--ss _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t]
                   (alias: ddeettaacchh)
             Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with --tt, or
             all clients currently attached to the session specified by --ss.  The --aa option
             kills all but the client given with --tt.  If --PP is given, send SIGHUP to the par‐
             ent process of the client, typically causing it to exit.  With --EE, run
             _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d to replace the client.

     hhaass--sseessssiioonn [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: hhaass)
             Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If it
             does exist, exit with 0.

     kkiillll--sseerrvveerr
             Kill the ttmmuuxx server and clients and destroy all sessions.

     kkiillll--sseessssiioonn [--aaCC] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
             Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other ses‐
             sions, and detaching all clients attached to it.  If --aa is given, all sessions
             but the specified one is killed.  The --CC flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or
             silence) in all windows linked to the session.

     lliisstt--cclliieennttss [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]

             Create a new session with name _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e.

             The new session is attached to the current terminal unless --dd is given.
             _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_n_a_m_e and _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d are the name of and shell command to execute in
             the initial window.  With --dd, the initial size comes from the global
             ddeeffaauulltt--ssiizzee option; --xx and --yy can be used to specify a different size.  ‘-’
             uses the size of the current client if any.  If --xx or --yy is given, the
             ddeeffaauulltt--ssiizzee option is set for the session.  --ff sets a comma-separated list of
             client flags (see aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn).

             If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are saved and used for
             new windows in the new session.

             The --AA flag makes nneeww--sseessssiioonn behave like aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn if _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e already
             exists; in this case, --DD behaves like --dd to aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn, and --XX behaves like
             --xx to aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn.

             If --tt is given, it specifies a sseessssiioonn ggrroouupp.  Sessions in the same group share
             the same set of windows - new windows are linked to all sessions in the group
             and any windows closed removed from all sessions.  The current and previous win‐
             dow and any session options remain independent and any session in a group may be
             killed without affecting the others.  The _g_r_o_u_p_-_n_a_m_e argument may be:

             1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is added to
                     that group;

             2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is added to the same
                     group as that session, creating a new group if necessary;

             3.      the name for a new group containing only the new session.

             --nn and _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d are invalid if --tt is used.

             The --PP option prints information about the new session after it has been cre‐
             ated.  By default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format
             may be specified with --FF.

             If --EE is used, the uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt option will not be applied.  --ee takes the
             form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment variable for the newly created
             session; it may be specified multiple times.

                   (alias: rreeffrreesshh)
             Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given
             with --tt.  If --SS is specified, only update the client's status line.

             The --UU, --DD, --LL --RR, and --cc flags allow the visible portion of a window which is
             larger than the client to be changed.  --UU moves the visible part up by
             _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t rows and --DD down, --LL left by _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t columns and --RR right.  --cc re‐
             turns to tracking the cursor automatically.  If _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t is omitted, 1 is
             used.  Note that the visible position is a property of the client not of the
             window, changing the current window in the attached session will reset it.

             --CC sets the width and height of a control mode client.  --AA allows a control mode
             client to trigger actions on a pane.  The argument is a pane ID (with leading
             ‘%’), a colon, then one of ‘on’, ‘off’, ‘continue’ or ‘pause’.  If ‘off’, ttmmuuxx
             will not send output from the pane to the client and if all clients have turned
             the pane off, will stop reading from the pane.  If ‘continue’, ttmmuuxx will return
             to sending output to the pane if it was paused (manually or with the _p_a_u_s_e_-_a_f_t_e_r
             flag).  If ‘pause’, ttmmuuxx will pause the pane.  --AA may be given multiple times
             for different panes.

             --BB sets a subscription to a format for a control mode client.  The argument is
             split into three items by colons: _n_a_m_e is a name for the subscription; _w_h_a_t is a
             type of item to subscribe to; _f_o_r_m_a_t is the format.  After a subscription is
             added, changes to the format are reported with the %%ssuubbssccrriippttiioonn--cchhaannggeedd notifi‐
             cation, at most once a second.  If only the name is given, the subscription is
             removed.  _w_h_a_t may be empty to check the format only for the attached session,
             or one of: a pane ID such as ‘%0’; ‘%*’ for all panes in the attached session; a
             window ID such as ‘@0’; or ‘@*’ for all windows in the attached session.

             --ff sets a comma-separated list of client flags, see aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn.

             --ll requests the clipboard from the client using the xterm(1) escape sequence and
             stores it in a new paste buffer.

             --LL, --RR, --UU and --DD move the visible portion of the window left, right, up or down
             by _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t, if the window is larger than the client.  --cc resets so that the
             position follows the cursor.  See the wwiinnddooww--ssiizzee option.

             special case, --tt may refer to a pane (a target that contains ‘:’, ‘.’ or ‘%’),
             to change session, window and pane.  In that case, --ZZ keeps the window zoomed if
             it was zoomed.  If --ll, --nn or --pp is used, the client is moved to the last, next
             or previous session respectively.  --rr toggles the client rreeaadd--oonnllyy and
             iiggnnoorree--ssiizzee flags (see the aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn command).

             --TT sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted
             from _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e.  This may be used to configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind

WWIINNDDOOWWSS AANNDD PPAANNEESS
     Each window displayed by ttmmuuxx may be split into one or more _p_a_n_e_s; each pane takes up a
     certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.  A window may be split into
     panes using the sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww command.  Windows may be split horizontally (with the --hh
     flag) or vertically.  Panes may be resized with the rreessiizzee--ppaannee command (bound to
     ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’ and ‘C-Right’ by default), the current pane may be changed
     with the sseelleecctt--ppaannee command and the rroottaattee--wwiinnddooww and sswwaapp--ppaannee commands may be used to
     swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered beginning from zero in
     the order they are created.

     By default, a ttmmuuxx pane permits direct access to the terminal contained in the pane.  A
     pane may also be put into one of several modes:

           --   Copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to
               a _p_a_s_t_e _b_u_f_f_e_r for later insertion into another window.  This mode is entered
               with the ccooppyy--mmooddee command, bound to ‘[’ by default.  Copied text can be
               pasted with the ppaassttee--bbuuffffeerr command, bound to ‘]’.

           --   View mode, which is like copy mode but is entered when a command that produces
               output, such as lliisstt--kkeeyyss, is executed from a key binding.

           --   Choose mode, which allows an item to be chosen from a list.  This may be a
               client, a session or window or pane, or a buffer.  This mode is entered with
               the cchhoooossee--bbuuffffeerr, cchhoooossee--cclliieenntt and cchhoooossee--ttrreeee commands.

     In copy mode an indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of the pane with the cur‐
     rent position and the number of lines in the history.

     Commands are sent to copy mode using the --XX flag to the sseenndd--kkeeyyss command.  When a key
     is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two key tables, depending on the
     mmooddee--kkeeyyss option: ccooppyy--mmooddee for emacs, or ccooppyy--mmooddee--vvii for vi.  Key tables may be viewed
     with the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command.

     The following commands are supported in copy mode:

           CCoommmmaanndd                                      vvii              eemmaaccss

     The search commands come in several varieties: ‘search-forward’ and ‘search-backward’
     search for a regular expression; the ‘-text’ variants search for a plain text string
     rather than a regular expression; ‘-incremental’ perform an incremental search and ex‐
     pect to be used with the --ii flag to the ccoommmmaanndd--pprroommpptt command.  ‘search-again’ repeats
     the last search and ‘search-reverse’ does the same but reverses the direction (forward
     becomes backward and backward becomes forward).

     Copy commands may take an optional buffer prefix argument which is used to generate the
     buffer name (the default is ‘buffer’ so buffers are named ‘buffer0’, ‘buffer1’ and so
     on).  Pipe commands take a command argument which is the command to which the selected
     text is piped.  ‘copy-pipe’ variants also copy the selection.  The ‘-and-cancel’ vari‐
     ants of some commands exit copy mode after they have completed (for copy commands) or
     when the cursor reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).  ‘-no-clear’ variants do
     not clear the selection.

     The next and previous word keys use space and the ‘-’, ‘_’ and ‘@’ characters as word
     delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by setting the _w_o_r_d_-_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r_s session
     option.  Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the
     next word and previous word to the start of the previous word.  The three next and pre‐
     vious space keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word separator.

     The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’ fol‐
     lowed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the next ‘/’ character on the current line.  A ‘;’
     will then jump to the next occurrence.

     Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key bind‐
     ings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a
     number begins prefix entry.

     The synopsis for the ccooppyy--mmooddee command is:

     ccooppyy--mmooddee [--eeHHMMqquu] [--ss _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
             Enter copy mode.  The --uu option scrolls one page up.  --MM begins a mouse drag
             (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T).  --HH hides the
             position indicator in the top right.  --qq cancels copy mode and any other modes.
             --ss copies from _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e instead of _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e.

             --ee specifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen)
             should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode, pressing a key other than those used
             for scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is intended to allow fast
             scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:

                   bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

     A number of preset arrangements of panes are available, these are called layouts.  These
     may be selected with the sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt command or cycled with nneexxtt--llaayyoouutt (bound to
     ‘Space’ by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized
     as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     eevveenn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall
             Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

     eevveenn--vveerrttiiccaall
             Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     mmaaiinn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall
             A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes
             are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.  Use the
             _m_a_i_n_-_p_a_n_e_-_h_e_i_g_h_t window option to specify the height of the top pane.

     mmaaiinn--vveerrttiiccaall
             Similar to mmaaiinn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall but the large pane is placed on the left and the oth‐
             ers spread from top to bottom along the right.  See the _m_a_i_n_-_p_a_n_e_-_w_i_d_t_h window
             option.

     ttiilleedd   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and col‐
             umns.

     In addition, sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt may be used to apply a previously used layout - the
     lliisstt--wwiinnddoowwss command displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use with
     sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt.  For example:

           $ tmux list-windows
           0: ksh [159x48]
               layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
           $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

     ttmmuuxx automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note
     that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that from which the
     layout was originally defined.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     bbrreeaakk--ppaannee [--aabbddPP] [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--nn _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_n_a_m_e] [--ss _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e] [--tt _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w]
                   (alias: bbrreeaakkpp)
             Break _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e off from its containing window to make it the only pane in
             _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w.  With --aa or --bb, the window is moved to the next index after or be‐
             fore (existing windows are moved if necessary).  If --dd is given, the new window
             does not become the current window.  The --PP option prints information about the
             new window after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format
             ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}.#{pane_index}’ but a different format may be
             specified with --FF.

     ccaappttuurree--ppaannee [--aaeeppPPqqCCJJNN] [--bb _b_u_f_f_e_r_-_n_a_m_e] [--EE _e_n_d_-_l_i_n_e] [--SS _s_t_a_r_t_-_l_i_n_e] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
                   (alias: ccaappttuurreepp)
             Capture the contents of a pane.  If --pp is given, the output goes to stdout, oth‐
             erwise to the buffer specified with --bb or a new buffer if omitted.  If --aa is
             given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.  If no
             alternate screen exists, an error will be returned unless --qq is given.  If --ee is
             given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background attributes.
             --CC also escapes non-printable characters as octal \xxx.  --NN preserves trailing
             spaces at each line's end and --JJ preserves trailing spaces and joins any wrapped
             lines.  --PP captures only any output that the pane has received that is the be‐
             ginning of an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.

             --SS and --EE specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line
             of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  ‘-’ to --SS is
             the start of the history and to --EE the end of the visible pane.  The default is
             to capture only the visible contents of the pane.

             Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from
             a list.  Each client is shown on one line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left
             in brackets allowing for immediate choice, or the list may be navigated and an
             item chosen or otherwise manipulated using the keys below.  --ZZ zooms the pane.
             The following keys may be used in client mode:

                   KKeeyy    FFuunnccttiioonn
                   Enter  Choose selected client

                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if client is tagged
                   T      Tag no clients
                   C-t    Tag all clients
                   d      Detach selected client
                   D      Detach tagged clients
                   x      Detach and HUP selected client
                   X      Detach and HUP tagged clients
                   z      Suspend selected client
                   Z      Suspend tagged clients
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort field
                   r      Reverse sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and
             the result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "detach-client -t
             '%%'" is used.

             --OO specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘name’, ‘size’, ‘creation’, or
             ‘activity’.  --rr reverses the sort order.  --ff specifies an initial filter: the
             filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown,
             otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.
             --FF specifies the format for each item in the list and --KK a format for each

             Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may be chosen inter‐
             actively from a tree.  Each session, window or pane is shown on one line.  A
             shortcut key is shown on the left in brackets allowing for immediate choice, or
             the tree may be navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated using the
             keys below.  --ss starts with sessions collapsed and --ww with windows collapsed.
             --ZZ zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in tree mode:

             After a session, window or pane is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the target in
             _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and the result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given,
             "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

             --OO specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or ‘time’.  --rr re‐
             verses the sort order.  --ff specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format -
             if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is
             shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  --FF specifies
             the format for each item in the tree and --KK a format for each shortcut key; both
             are evaluated once for each line.  --NN starts without the preview.  --GG includes
             all sessions in any session groups in the tree rather than only the first.  This
             command works only if at least one client is attached.

             would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  --FF specifies the format for each

             of zero means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.  While the indicator
             is on screen, a pane may be chosen with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys, which will cause
             _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e to be executed as a command with ‘%%’ substituted by the pane ID.  The
             default _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is "select-pane -t '%%'".  With --bb, other commands are not
             blocked from running until the indicator is closed.

             case.  The default is --CCNNTT.  --ZZ zooms the pane.

             If --dd is given, the session does not make the new window the current window.
             _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w represents the window to be created; if the target already exists
             an error is shown, unless the --kk flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.

             --ee takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment variable for the
             newly created window; it may be specified multiple times.

             The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’ for all programs
             running _i_n_s_i_d_e ttmmuuxx.  New windows will automatically have ‘TERM=screen’ added to
             their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up
             files or by the --ee option.

             The --PP option prints information about the new window after it has been created.
             By default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different
             format may be specified with --FF.

             A pane may only be connected to one command at a time, any existing pipe is
             closed before _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed.  The _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d string may contain

             _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

             --II and --OO specify which of the _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d output streams are connected to the
             pane: with --II stdout is connected (so anything _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d prints is written
             to the pane as if it were typed); with --OO stdin is connected (so any output in
             the pane is piped to _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d).  Both may be used together and if neither

             The --oo option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe
             to be toggled with a single key, for example:

     key names are accepted: _U_p, _D_o_w_n, _L_e_f_t, _R_i_g_h_t, _B_S_p_a_c_e, _B_T_a_b, _D_C (Delete), _E_n_d, _E_n_t_e_r,
     _E_s_c_a_p_e, _F_1 to _F_1_2, _H_o_m_e, _I_C (Insert), _N_P_a_g_e_/_P_a_g_e_D_o_w_n_/_P_g_D_n, _P_P_a_g_e_/_P_a_g_e_U_p_/_P_g_U_p, _S_p_a_c_e, and
     _T_a_b.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’ keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:

           bind-key '"' split-window
           bind-key "'" new-window

     A command bound to the _A_n_y key will execute for all keys which do not have a more spe‐
     cific binding.

     Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

     bbiinndd--kkeeyy [--nnrr] [--NN _n_o_t_e] [--TT _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e] _k_e_y _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]
                   (alias: bbiinndd)
             Bind key _k_e_y to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (without
             -T), the key is bound in the _p_r_e_f_i_x key table.  This table is used for keys
             pressed after the prefix key (for example, by default ‘c’ is bound to nneeww--wwiinnddooww
             in the _p_r_e_f_i_x table, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new window).  The _r_o_o_t table is used
             for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to nneeww--wwiinnddooww in the _r_o_o_t
             table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’ will create a new window.  --nn is an
             alias for --TT _r_o_o_t.  Keys may also be bound in custom key tables and the
             sswwiittcchh--cclliieenntt --TT command used to switch to them from a key binding.  The --rr flag
             indicates this key may repeat, see the rreeppeeaatt--ttiimmee option.  --NN attaches a note
             to the key (shown with lliisstt--kkeeyyss --NN).

             To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command.

     lliisstt--kkeeyyss [--11aaNN] [--PP _p_r_e_f_i_x_-_s_t_r_i_n_g --TT _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e] [_k_e_y]
                   (alias: llsskk)
             List key bindings.  There are two forms: the default lists keys as bbiinndd--kkeeyy com‐
             mands; --NN lists only keys with attached notes and shows only the key and note
             for each key.

             With the default form, all key tables are listed by default.  --TT lists only keys
             in _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e.

             With the --NN form, only keys in the _r_o_o_t and _p_r_e_f_i_x key tables are listed by de‐
             fault; --TT also lists only keys in _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e.  --PP specifies a prefix to print be‐
             fore each key and --11 lists only the first matching key.  --aa lists the command
             for keys that do not have a note rather than skipping them.

     sseenndd--kkeeyyss [--FFHHllMMRRXX] [--NN _r_e_p_e_a_t_-_c_o_u_n_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e] _k_e_y _._._.
                   (alias: sseenndd)
             Send a key or keys to a window.  Each argument _k_e_y is the name of the key (such
             as ‘C-a’ or ‘NPage’) to send; if the string is not recognised as a key, it is
             sent as a series of characters.  All arguments are sent sequentially from first
             to last.

             The --ll flag disables key name lookup and processes the keys as literal UTF-8
             characters.  The --HH flag expects each key to be a hexadecimal number for an
             ASCII character.

             The --RR flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

             --MM passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
             _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T).

             --XX is used to send a command into copy mode - see the _W_I_N_D_O_W_S _A_N_D _P_A_N_E_S section.
             --NN specifies a repeat count and --FF expands formats in arguments where appropri‐
             ate.

             Send the prefix key, or with --22 the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it
             was pressed.

     uunnbbiinndd--kkeeyy [--aannqq] [--TT _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e] _k_e_y
                   (alias: uunnbbiinndd)
             Unbind the command bound to _k_e_y.  --nn and --TT are the same as for bbiinndd--kkeeyy.  If --aa
             is present, all key bindings are removed.  The --qq option prevents errors being
             returned.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The appearance and behaviour of ttmmuuxx may be modified by changing the value of various
     options.  There are four types of option: _s_e_r_v_e_r _o_p_t_i_o_n_s, _s_e_s_s_i_o_n _o_p_t_i_o_n_s, _w_i_n_d_o_w
     _o_p_t_i_o_n_s, and _p_a_n_e _o_p_t_i_o_n_s.

     The ttmmuuxx server has a set of global server options which do not apply to any particular
     window or session or pane.  These are altered with the sseett--ooppttiioonn --ss command, or dis‐
     played with the sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss --ss command.

     In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a
     separate set of global session options.  Sessions which do not have a particular option
     configured inherit the value from the global session options.  Session options are set
     or unset with the sseett--ooppttiioonn command and may be listed with the sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss command.
     The available server and session options are listed under the sseett--ooppttiioonn command.

     Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window and a set of pane options
     to each pane.  Pane options inherit from window options.  This means any pane option may
     be set as a window option to apply the option to all panes in the window without the op‐
     tion set, for example these commands will set the background colour to red for all panes
     except pane 0:

           set -w window-style bg=red
           set -pt:.0 window-style bg=blue

     There is also a set of global window options from which any unset window or pane options
     are inherited.  Window and pane options are altered with sseett--ooppttiioonn --ww and --pp commands
     and displayed with sshhooww--ooppttiioonn --ww and --pp.

     ttmmuuxx also supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User options may have
     any name, so long as they are prefixed with ‘@’, and be set to any string.  For example:

           $ tmux set -wq @foo "abc123"
           $ tmux show -wv @foo
           abc123

     Commands which set options are as follows:

     sseett--ooppttiioonn [--aaFFggooppqqssuuUUww] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e] _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e
                   (alias: sseett)
             Set a pane option with --pp, a window option with --ww, a server option with --ss,
             otherwise a session option.  If the option is not a user option, --ww or --ss may be
             unnecessary - ttmmuuxx will infer the type from the option name, assuming --ww for
             pane options.  If --gg is given, the global session or window option is set.

             --FF expands formats in the option value.  The --uu flag unsets an option, so a ses‐
             sion inherits the option from the global options (or with --gg, restores a global
             option to the default).  --UU unsets an option (like --uu) but if the option is a
             pane option also unsets the option on any panes in the window.  _v_a_l_u_e depends on
             the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or omitted to tog‐
             gle).

             The --oo flag prevents setting an option that is already set and the --qq flag sup‐
             presses errors about unknown or ambiguous options.

             With --aa, and if the option expects a string or a style, _v_a_l_u_e is appended to the
             existing setting.  For example:

                   set -g status-left "foo"
                   set -ag status-left "bar"

             Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:

                   set -g status-style "bg=red"
                   set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

             Will result in a red background _a_n_d blue foreground.  Without --aa, the result
             would be the default background and a blue foreground.

     sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss [--AAggHHppqqssvvww] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e] [_o_p_t_i_o_n]
                   (alias: sshhooww)
             Show the pane options (or a single option if _o_p_t_i_o_n is provided) with --pp, the
             window options with --ww, the server options with --ss, otherwise the session op‐
             tions.  If the option is not a user option, --ww or --ss may be unnecessary - ttmmuuxx
             will infer the type from the option name, assuming --ww for pane options.  Global
             session or window options are listed if --gg is used.  --vv shows only the option
             value, not the name.  If --qq is set, no error will be returned if _o_p_t_i_o_n is un‐
             set.  --HH includes hooks (omitted by default).  --AA includes options inherited
             from a parent set of options, such options are marked with an asterisk.

     Available server options are:

     bbaacckkssppaaccee _k_e_y
             Set the key sent by ttmmuuxx for backspace.

     bbuuffffeerr--lliimmiitt _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack, old
             ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum length.

     ccoommmmaanndd--aalliiaass[[]] _n_a_m_e_=_v_a_l_u_e
             This is an array of custom aliases for commands.  If an unknown command matches
             _n_a_m_e, it is replaced with _v_a_l_u_e.  For example, after:

                   set -s command-alias[100] zoom='resize-pane -Z'

             Using:

                   zoom -t:.1

             Is equivalent to:

                   resize-pane -Z -t:.1

             Note that aliases are expanded when a command is parsed rather than when it is
             executed, so binding an alias with bbiinndd--kkeeyy will bind the expanded form.

     ddeeffaauulltt--tteerrmmiinnaall _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l
             Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the default
             value of the TERM environment variable.  For ttmmuuxx to work correctly, this _m_u_s_t
             be set to ‘screen’, ‘tmux’ or a derivative of them.

             Give the command to pipe to if the ccooppyy--ppiippee copy mode command is used without
             arguments.

     eessccaappee--ttiimmee _t_i_m_e
             Set the time in milliseconds for which ttmmuuxx waits after an escape is input to
             determine if it is part of a function or meta key sequences.  The default is 500
             milliseconds.

     eeddiittoorr _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Set the command used when ttmmuuxx runs an editor.

     eexxiitt--eemmppttyy [oonn | ooffff]
             If enabled (the default), the server will exit when there are no active ses‐
             sions.

     eexxiitt--uunnaattttaacchheedd [oonn | ooffff]
             If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.

     eexxtteennddeedd--kkeeyyss [oonn | ooffff]
             When enabled, extended keys are requested from the terminal and if supported are
             recognised by ttmmuuxx.

     ffooccuuss--eevveennttss [oonn | ooffff]
             When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if supported and
             passed through to applications running in ttmmuuxx.  Attached clients should be de‐
             tached and attached again after changing this option.

     hhiissttoorryy--ffiillee _p_a_t_h
             If not empty, a file to which ttmmuuxx will write command prompt history on exit and
             load it from on start.

     mmeessssaaggee--lliimmiitt _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Set the number of error or information messages to save in the message log for
             each client.  The default is 100.

     sseett--cclliippbbooaarrdd [oonn | eexxtteerrnnaall | ooffff]
             Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the xterm(1) escape se‐
             quence, if there is an _M_s entry in the terminfo(5) description (see the _T_E_R_M_I_N_F_O
             _E_X_T_E_N_S_I_O_N_S section).

             If set to oonn, ttmmuuxx will both accept the escape sequence to create a buffer and
             attempt to set the terminal clipboard.  If set to eexxtteerrnnaall, ttmmuuxx will attempt to
             set the terminal clipboard but ignore attempts by applications to set ttmmuuxx buf‐
             fers.  If ooffff, ttmmuuxx will neither accept the clipboard escape sequence nor at‐
             tempt to set the clipboard.

             Note that this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1) by setting the resource:

                   disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

             Or changing this property from the xterm(1) interactive menu when required.

             Set terminal features for terminal types read from terminfo(5).  ttmmuuxx has a set
             of named terminal features.  Each will apply appropriate changes to the
             terminfo(5) entry in use.

             ttmmuuxx can detect features for a few common terminals; this option can be used to
             easily tell tmux about features supported by terminals it cannot detect.  The
             tteerrmmiinnaall--oovveerrrriiddeess option allows individual terminfo(5) capabilities to be set

             a standard way but not reported by terminfo(5).  Care must be taken only to con‐
             figure this with features the terminal actually support.

             This is an array option where each entry is a colon-separated string made up of
             a terminal type pattern (matched using fnmatch(3)) followed by a list of termi‐
             nal features.  The available features are:

             256     Supports 256 colours with the SGR escape sequences.

             clipboard
                     Allows setting the system clipboard.

             ccolour
                     Allows setting the cursor colour.

             cstyle  Allows setting the cursor style.

             extkeys
                     Supports extended keys.

             focus   Supports focus reporting.

     tteerrmmiinnaall--oovveerrrriiddeess[[]] _s_t_r_i_n_g
             Allow terminal descriptions read using terminfo(5) to be overridden.  Each entry
             is a colon-separated string made up of a terminal type pattern (matched using
             fnmatch(3)) and a set of _n_a_m_e_=_v_a_l_u_e entries.

             For example, to set the ‘clear’ terminfo(5) entry to ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all termi‐
             nal types matching ‘rxvt*’:

                   rxvt*:clear=\e[H\e[2J

             The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation.

     uusseerr--kkeeyyss[[]] _k_e_y
             Set list of user-defined key escape sequences.  Each item is associated with a
             key named ‘User0’, ‘User1’, and so on.

             For example:

                   set -s user-keys[0] "\e[5;30012~"
                   bind User0 resize-pane -L 3

     Available session options are:

     aaccttiivviittyy--aaccttiioonn [aannyy | nnoonnee | ccuurrrreenntt | ootthheerr]
             Set action on window activity when mmoonniittoorr--aaccttiivviittyy is on.  aannyy means activity
             in any window linked to a session causes a bell or message (depending on
             vviissuuaall--aaccttiivviittyy) in the current window of that session, nnoonnee means all activity
             is ignored (equivalent to mmoonniittoorr--aaccttiivviittyy being off), ccuurrrreenntt means only activ‐
             ity in windows other than the current window are ignored and ootthheerr means activ‐
             ity in the current window is ignored but not those in other windows.

             If keys are entered faster than one in _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s, they are assumed to have
             been pasted rather than typed and ttmmuuxx key bindings are not processed.  The de‐
             fault is one millisecond and zero disables.

     bbaassee--iinnddeexx _i_n_d_e_x
             Set the base index from which an unused index should be searched when a new win‐
             dow is created.  The default is zero.

     bbeellll--aaccttiioonn [aannyy | nnoonnee | ccuurrrreenntt | ootthheerr]
             Set action on a bell in a window when mmoonniittoorr--bbeellll is on.  The values are the
             same as those for aaccttiivviittyy--aaccttiioonn.

             Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the window is cre‐
             ated) to _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d, which may be any sh(1) command.  The default is an empty
             string, which instructs ttmmuuxx to create a login shell using the value of the
             ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll option.

     ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll _p_a_t_h
             Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login shell for new windows when
             the ddeeffaauulltt--ccoommmmaanndd option is set to empty, and must be the full path of the ex‐
             ecutable.  When started ttmmuuxx tries to set a default value from the first suit‐
             able of the SHELL environment variable, the shell returned by getpwuid(3), or
             _/_b_i_n_/_s_h.  This option should be configured when ttmmuuxx is used as a login shell.

     ddeeffaauulltt--ssiizzee _X_x_Y
             Set the default size of new windows when the wwiinnddooww--ssiizzee option is set to manual
             or when a session is created with nneeww--sseessssiioonn --dd.  The value is the width and
             height separated by an ‘x’ character.  The default is 80x24.

     ddeessttrrooyy--uunnaattttaacchheedd [oonn | ooffff]
             If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any clients, it is de‐
             stroyed.

     ddeettaacchh--oonn--ddeessttrrooyy [ooffff | oonn | nnoo--ddeettaacchheedd]
             If on (the default), the client is detached when the session it is attached to
             is destroyed.  If off, the client is switched to the most recently active of the
             remaining sessions.  If nnoo--ddeettaacchheedd, the client is detached only if there are no
             detached sessions; if detached sessions exist, the client is switched to the
             most recently active.

             Set the colour used by the ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess command to show the indicators for in‐
             active panes.

     ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess--ttiimmee _t_i_m_e
             Set the time in milliseconds for which the indicators shown by the ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess
             command appear.

     ddiissppllaayy--ttiimmee _t_i_m_e
             Set the amount of time for which status line messages and other on-screen indi‐
             cators are displayed.  If set to 0, messages and indicators are displayed until
             a key is pressed.  _t_i_m_e is in milliseconds.

     hhiissttoorryy--lliimmiitt _l_i_n_e_s
             Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.  This setting applies
             only to new windows - existing window histories are not resized and retain the
             limit at the point they were created.

     kkeeyy--ttaabbllee _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e
             Set the default key table to _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e instead of _r_o_o_t.

     lloocckk--aafftteerr--ttiimmee _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Lock the session (like the lloocckk--sseessssiioonn command) after _n_u_m_b_e_r seconds of inac‐
             tivity.  The default is not to lock (set to 0).

             Command to run when locking each client.  The default is to run lock(1) with
             --nnpp.

     mmeessssaaggee--ccoommmmaanndd--ssttyyllee _s_t_y_l_e
             Set status line message command style.  This is used for the command prompt with
             vi(1) keys when in command mode.  For how to specify _s_t_y_l_e, see the _S_T_Y_L_E_S sec‐
             tion.

     mmeessssaaggee--ssttyyllee _s_t_y_l_e
             Set status line message style.  This is used for messages and for the command
             prompt.  For how to specify _s_t_y_l_e, see the _S_T_Y_L_E_S section.

     mmoouussee [oonn | ooffff]
             If on, ttmmuuxx captures the mouse and allows mouse events to be bound as key bind‐
             ings.  See the _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T section for details.

     pprreeffiixx _k_e_y
             Set the key accepted as a prefix key.  In addition to the standard keys de‐
             scribed under _K_E_Y _B_I_N_D_I_N_G_S, pprreeffiixx can be set to the special key ‘None’ to set
             no prefix.

     pprreeffiixx22 _k_e_y
             Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.  Like pprreeffiixx, pprreeffiixx22 can be set
             to ‘None’.

     rreennuummbbeerr--wwiinnddoowwss [oonn | ooffff]
             If on, when a window is closed in a session, automatically renumber the other
             windows in numerical order.  This respects the bbaassee--iinnddeexx option if it has been
             set.  If off, do not renumber the windows.

     rreeppeeaatt--ttiimmee _t_i_m_e
             Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the prefix-key again in
             the specified _t_i_m_e milliseconds (the default is 500).  Whether a key repeats may
             be set when it is bound using the --rr flag to bbiinndd--kkeeyy.  Repeat is enabled for
             the default keys bound to the rreessiizzee--ppaannee command.

     sseett--ttiittlleess [oonn | ooffff]
             Attempt to set the client terminal title using the _t_s_l and _f_s_l terminfo(5) en‐
             tries if they exist.  ttmmuuxx automatically sets these to the \e]0;...\007 sequence
             if the terminal appears to be xterm(1).  This option is off by default.

     sseett--ttiittlleess--ssttrriinngg _s_t_r_i_n_g
             String used to set the client terminal title if sseett--ttiittlleess is on.  Formats are
             expanded, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.

             Set action on window silence when mmoonniittoorr--ssiilleennccee is on.  The values are the
             same as those for aaccttiivviittyy--aaccttiioonn.

     ssttaattuuss [ooffff | oonn | 22 | 33 | 44 | 55]
             Show or hide the status line or specify its size.  Using oonn gives a status line
             one row in height; 22, 33, 44 or 55 more rows.

     ssttaattuuss--ffoorrmmaatt[[]] _f_o_r_m_a_t
             Specify the format to be used for each line of the status line.  The default
             builds the top status line from the various individual status options below.

     ssttaattuuss--iinntteerrvvaall _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
             Update the status line every _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l seconds.  By default, updates will occur
             every 15 seconds.  A setting of zero disables redrawing at interval.

             Set the position of the window list in the status line: left, centre or right.
             centre puts the window list in the relative centre of the available free space;
             absolute-centre uses the centre of the entire horizontal space.

     ssttaattuuss--kkeeyyss [vvii | eemmaaccss]
             Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for example at the com‐
             mand prompt.  The default is emacs, unless the VISUAL or EDITOR environment
             variables are set and contain the string ‘vi’.

     ssttaattuuss--lleefftt _s_t_r_i_n_g
             Display _s_t_r_i_n_g (by default the session name) to the left of the status line.
             _s_t_r_i_n_g will be passed through strftime(3).  Also see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S and _S_T_Y_L_E_S sec‐
             tions.

             tion.

             Examples are:

                   #(sysctl vm.loadavg)
                   #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]

             The default is ‘[#S] ’.

     ssttaattuuss--lleefftt--lleennggtthh _l_e_n_g_t_h
             Set the maximum _l_e_n_g_t_h of the left component of the status line.  The default is
             10.

     ssttaattuuss--lleefftt--ssttyyllee _s_t_y_l_e
             Set the style of the left part of the status line.  For how to specify _s_t_y_l_e,
             see the _S_T_Y_L_E_S section.

     ssttaattuuss--ppoossiittiioonn [ttoopp | bboottttoomm]
             Set the position of the status line.

     ssttaattuuss--rriigghhtt _s_t_r_i_n_g
             Display _s_t_r_i_n_g to the right of the status line.  By default, the current pane
             title in double quotes, the date and the time are shown.  As with ssttaattuuss--lleefftt,
             _s_t_r_i_n_g will be passed to strftime(3) and character pairs are replaced.

             Set list of environment variables to be copied into the session environment when
             a new session is created or an existing session is attached.  Any variables that
             do not exist in the source environment are set to be removed from the session
             environment (as if --rr was given to the sseett--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt command).

             Also see the bbeellll--aaccttiioonn option.

     vviissuuaall--ssiilleennccee [oonn | ooffff | bbootthh]
             If mmoonniittoorr--ssiilleennccee is enabled, prints a message after the interval has expired
             on a given window instead of sending a bell.  If set to both, a bell and a mes‐
             sage are produced.

     wwoorrdd--sseeppaarraattoorrss _s_t_r_i_n_g
             Sets the session's conception of what characters are considered word separators,
             for the purposes of the next and previous word commands in copy mode.  The de‐
             fault is ‘ -_@’.

     Available window options are:

     aaggggrreessssiivvee--rreessiizzee [oonn | ooffff]
             Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that ttmmuuxx will resize the
             window to the size of the smallest or largest session (see the wwiinnddooww--ssiizzee op‐
             tion) for which it is the current window, rather than the session to which it is
             attached.  The window may resize when the current window is changed on another
             session; this option is good for full-screen programs which support SIGWINCH and
             poor for interactive programs such as shells.

     aauuttoommaattiicc--rreennaammee [oonn | ooffff]
             Control automatic window renaming.  When this setting is enabled, ttmmuuxx will re‐
             name the window automatically using the format specified by
             aauuttoommaattiicc--rreennaammee--ffoorrmmaatt.  This flag is automatically disabled for an individual
             window when a name is specified at creation with nneeww--wwiinnddooww or nneeww--sseessssiioonn, or
             later with rreennaammee--wwiinnddooww, or with a terminal escape sequence.  It may be
             switched off globally with:

             Configure how ttmmuuxx determines the window size.  If set to _l_a_r_g_e_s_t, the size of
             the largest attached session is used; if _s_m_a_l_l_e_s_t, the size of the smallest.  If
             _m_a_n_u_a_l, the size of a new window is set from the ddeeffaauulltt--ssiizzee option and windows
             are resized automatically.  With _l_a_t_e_s_t, ttmmuuxx uses the size of the client that

     wwrraapp--sseeaarrcchh [oonn | ooffff]
             If this option is set, searches will wrap around the end of the pane contents.
             The default is on.

     Available pane options are:

     aallllooww--rreennaammee [oonn | ooffff]
             Allow programs in the pane to change the window name using a terminal escape se‐
             quence (\ek...\e\\).

     aalltteerrnnaattee--ssccrreeeenn [oonn | ooffff]
             This option configures whether programs running inside the pane may use the ter‐
             minal alternate screen feature, which allows the _s_m_c_u_p and _r_m_c_u_p terminfo(5) ca‐
             pabilities.  The alternate screen feature preserves the contents of the window
             when an interactive application starts and restores it on exit, so that any out‐
             put visible before the application starts reappears unchanged after it exits.

     rreemmaaiinn--oonn--eexxiitt [oonn | ooffff | ffaaiilleedd]
             A pane with this flag set is not destroyed when the program running in it exits.
             If set to ffaaiilleedd, then only when the program exit status is not zero.  The pane
             may be reactivated with the rreessppaawwnn--ppaannee command.

     ssyynncchhrroonniizzee--ppaanneess [oonn | ooffff]
             Duplicate input to all other panes in the same window where this option is also
             on (only for panes that are not in any mode).

     wwiinnddooww--aaccttiivvee--ssttyyllee _s_t_y_l_e
             Set the pane style when it is the active pane.  For how to specify _s_t_y_l_e, see
             the _S_T_Y_L_E_S section.

     wwiinnddooww--ssttyyllee _s_t_y_l_e

HHOOOOKKSS
     ttmmuuxx allows commands to run on various triggers, called _h_o_o_k_s.  Most ttmmuuxx commands have
     an _a_f_t_e_r hook and there are a number of hooks not associated with commands.

     Hooks are stored as array options, members of the array are executed in order when the
     hook is triggered.  Like options different hooks may be global or belong to a session,
     window or pane.  Hooks may be configured with the sseett--hhooookk or sseett--ooppttiioonn commands and
     displayed with sshhooww--hhooookkss or sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss --HH.  The following two commands are equiva‐
     lent:

            set-hook -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'
            set-option -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'

     Setting a hook without specifying an array index clears the hook and sets the first mem‐
     ber of the array.

     A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the command is run as part
     of a hook itself.  They are named with an ‘after-’ prefix.  For example, the following
     command adds a hook to select the even-vertical layout after every sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww:

           set-hook -g after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

     All the notifications listed in the _C_O_N_T_R_O_L _M_O_D_E section are hooks (without any argu‐
     ments), except %%eexxiitt.  The following additional hooks are available:

     alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See mmoonniittoorr--aaccttiivviittyy.

     alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.  See mmoonniittoorr--bbeellll.

     alert-silence           Run when a window has been silent.  See mmoonniittoorr--ssiilleennccee.

     client-attached         Run when a client is attached.

     client-detached         Run when a client is detached

     client-resized          Run when a client is resized.

     client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is changed.

     pane-died               Run when the program running in a pane exits, but rreemmaaiinn--oonn--eexxiitt
                             is on so the pane has not closed.

     pane-exited             Run when the program running in a pane exits.

     pane-focus-in           Run when the focus enters a pane, if the ffooccuuss--eevveennttss option is
                             on.

     pane-focus-out          Run when the focus exits a pane, if the ffooccuuss--eevveennttss option is
                             on.

     pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set using the xterm(1) escape
                             sequence.

     session-created         Run when a new session created.

     session-closed          Run when a session closed.

     session-renamed         Run when a session is renamed.

     window-linked           Run when a window is linked into a session.

     window-renamed          Run when a window is renamed.

     window-unlinked         Run when a window is unlinked from a session.

     Hooks are managed with these commands:

MMOOUUSSEE SSUUPPPPOORRTT
     If the mmoouussee option is on (the default is off), ttmmuuxx allows mouse events to be bound as
     keys.  The name of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as ‘MouseUp1’) and a loca‐
     tion suffix, one of the following:

           Pane             the contents of a pane
           Border           a pane border
           Status           the status line window list
           StatusLeft       the left part of the status line
           StatusRight      the right part of the status line
           StatusDefault    any other part of the status line

     The following mouse events are available:

           WheelUp       WheelDown
           MouseDown1    MouseUp1      MouseDrag1   MouseDragEnd1
           MouseDown2    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
           MouseDown3    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3
           SecondClick1  SecondClick2  SecondClick3
           DoubleClick1  DoubleClick2  DoubleClick3
           TripleClick1  TripleClick2  TripleClick3

     The ‘SecondClick’ events are fired for the second click of a double click, even if there
     may be a third click which will fire ‘TripleClick’ instead of ‘DoubleClick’.

     Each should be suffixed with a location, for example ‘MouseDown1Status’.

     The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e in com‐
     mands bound to mouse key bindings.  It resolves to the window or pane over which the
     mouse event took place (for example, the window in the status line over which button 1
     was released for a ‘MouseUp1Status’ binding, or the pane over which the wheel was
     scrolled for a ‘WheelDownPane’ binding).

     The sseenndd--kkeeyyss --MM flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.

     The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to copy
     text and to change window using the status line.  These take effect if the mmoouussee option
     is turned on.

FFOORRMMAATTSS
     Certain commands accept the --FF flag with a _f_o_r_m_a_t argument.  This is a string which con‐
     trols the output format of the command.  Format variables are enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’,
     for example ‘#{session_name}’.  The possible variables are listed in the table below, or
     the name of a ttmmuuxx option may be used for an option's value.  Some variables have a
     shorter alias such as ‘#S’; ‘##’ is replaced by a single ‘#’, ‘#,’ by a ‘,’ and ‘#}’ by
     a ‘}’.

     Conditionals are available by prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two alternatives with a
     comma; if the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alternative is cho‐
     sen, otherwise the second is used.  For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not
     attached}’ will include the string ‘attached’ if the session is attached and the string
     ‘not attached’ if it is unattached, or ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’ will include ‘yes’
     if aauuttoommaattiicc--rreennaammee is enabled, or ‘no’ if not.  Conditionals can be nested arbitrarily.
     Inside a conditional, ‘,’ and ‘}’ must be escaped as ‘#,’ and ‘#}’, unless they are part
     of a ‘#{...}’ replacement.  For example:

           #{?pane_in_mode,#[fg=white#,bg=red],#[fg=red#,bg=white]}#W .

     String comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-separated alternatives by
     ‘==’, ‘!=’, ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘<=’ or ‘>=’ and a colon.  For example ‘#{==:#{host},myhost}’ will
     be replaced by ‘1’ if running on ‘myhost’, otherwise by ‘0’.  ‘||’ and ‘&&’ evaluate to
     true if either or both of two comma-separated alternatives are true, for example
     ‘#{||:#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}’.

     An ‘m’ specifies an fnmatch(3) or regular expression comparison.  The first argument is
     the pattern and the second the string to compare.  An optional argument specifies flags:
     ‘r’ means the pattern is a regular expression instead of the default fnmatch(3) pattern,
     and ‘i’ means to ignore case.  For example: ‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’ or ‘#{m/ri:^A,MYVAR}’.
     A ‘C’ performs a search for an fnmatch(3) pattern or regular expression in the pane con‐
     tent and evaluates to zero if not found, or a line number if found.  Like ‘m’, an ‘r’
     flag means search for a regular expression and ‘i’ ignores case.  For example:
     ‘#{C/r:^Start}’

     Numeric operators may be performed by prefixing two comma-separated alternatives with an
     ‘e’ and an operator.  An optional ‘f’ flag may be given after the operator to use float‐
     ing point numbers, otherwise integers are used.  This may be followed by a number giving
     the number of decimal places to use for the result.  The available operators are: addi‐
     tion ‘+’, subtraction ‘-’, multiplication ‘*’, division ‘/’, modulus ‘m’ or ‘%’ (note
     that ‘%’ must be escaped as ‘%%’ in formats which are also expanded by strftime(3)) and
     numeric comparison operators ‘==’, ‘!=’, ‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>’ and ‘>=’.  For example,
     ‘#{e|*|f|4:5.5,3}’ multiplies 5.5 by 3 for a result with four decimal places and
     ‘#{e|%%:7,3}’ returns the modulus of 7 and 3.  ‘a’ replaces a numeric argument by its
     ASCII equivalent, so ‘#{a:98}’ results in ‘b’.

     A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an ‘=’, a
     number and a colon.  Positive numbers count from the start of the string and negative
     from the end, so ‘#{=5:pane_title}’ will include at most the first five characters of
     the pane title, or ‘#{=-5:pane_title}’ the last five characters.  A suffix or prefix may
     be given as a second argument - if provided then it is appended or prepended to the
     string if the length has been trimmed, for example ‘#{=/5/...:pane_title}’ will append
     ‘...’ if the pane title is more than five characters.  Similarly, ‘p’ pads the string to
     a given width, for example ‘#{p10:pane_title}’ will result in a width of at least 10
     characters.  A positive width pads on the left, a negative on the right.  ‘n’ expands to
     the length of the variable and ‘w’ to its width when displayed, for example
     ‘#{n:window_name}’.

     Prefixing a time variable with ‘t:’ will convert it to a string, so if
     ‘#{window_activity}’ gives ‘1445765102’, ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives ‘Sun Oct 25
     09:25:02 2015’.  Adding ‘p (’ ‘`t/p`’) will use shorter but less accurate time format
     for times in the past.  A custom format may be given using an ‘f’ suffix (note that ‘%’
     must be escaped as ‘%%’ if the format is separately being passed through strftime(3),
     for example in the ssttaattuuss--lleefftt option): ‘#{t/f/%%H#:%%M:window_activity}’, see
     strftime(3).

     The ‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are basename(3) and dirname(3) of the variable respectively.
     ‘q:’ will escape sh(1) special characters or with a ‘h’ suffix, escape hash characters
     (so ‘#’ becomes ‘##’).  ‘E:’ will expand the format twice, for example
     ‘#{E:status-left}’ is the result of expanding the content of the ssttaattuuss--lleefftt option
     rather than the option itself.  ‘T:’ is like ‘E:’ but also expands strftime(3) speci‐
     fiers.  ‘S:’, ‘W:’ or ‘P:’ will loop over each session, window or pane and insert the
     format once for each.  For windows and panes, two comma-separated formats may be given:
     the second is used for the current window or active pane.  For example, to get a list of
     windows formatted like the status line:

           #{W:#{E:window-status-format} ,#{E:window-status-current-format} }

     ‘N:’ checks if a window (without any suffix or with the ‘w’ suffix) or a session (with
     the ‘s’ suffix) name exists, for example ‘`N/w:foo`’ is replaced with 1 if a window
     named ‘foo’ exists.

     A prefix of the form ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ throughout.  The
     first argument may be an extended regular expression and a final argument may be ‘i’ to
     ignore case, for example ‘s/a(.)/\1x/i:’ would change ‘abABab’ into ‘bxBxbx’.

     In addition, the last line of a shell command's output may be inserted using ‘#()’.  For
     example, ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the system's uptime.  When constructing formats, ttmmuuxx
     does not wait for ‘#()’ commands to finish; instead, the previous result from running
     the same command is used, or a placeholder if the command has not been run before.  If
     the command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output will be used, but the status
     line will not be updated more than once a second.  Commands are executed with the ttmmuuxx
     global environment set (see the _G_L_O_B_A_L _A_N_D _S_E_S_S_I_O_N _E_N_V_I_R_O_N_M_E_N_T section).

     An ‘l’ specifies that a string should be interpreted literally and not expanded.  For
     example ‘#{l:#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}}’ will be replaced by ‘#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}’.

     The following variables are available, where appropriate:

SSTTYYLLEESS
     ttmmuuxx offers various options to specify the colour and attributes of aspects of the in‐
     terface, for example ssttaattuuss--ssttyyllee for the status line.  In addition, embedded styles may
     be specified in format options, such as ssttaattuuss--lleefftt, by enclosing them in ‘#[’ and ‘]’.

     A style may be the single term ‘default’ to specify the default style (which may come
     from an option, for example ssttaattuuss--ssttyyllee in the status line) or a space or comma sepa‐
     rated list of the following:

     ffgg==ccoolloouurr
             Set the foreground colour.  The colour is one of: bbllaacckk, rreedd, ggrreeeenn, yyeellllooww,
             bblluuee, mmaaggeennttaa, ccyyaann, wwhhiittee; if supported the bright variants bbrriigghhttrreedd,
             bbrriigghhttggrreeeenn, bbrriigghhttyyeellllooww; ccoolloouurr00 to ccoolloouurr225555 from the 256-colour set; ddeeffaauulltt
             for the default colour; tteerrmmiinnaall for the terminal default colour; or a hexadeci‐
             mal RGB string such as ‘#ffffff’.

     bbgg==ccoolloouurr
             Set the background colour.

     nnoonnee    Set no attributes (turn off any active attributes).

     aaccss, bbrriigghhtt (or bboolldd), ddiimm, uunnddeerrssccoorree, bblliinnkk, rreevveerrssee, hhiiddddeenn, iittaalliiccss, oovveerrlliinnee,

             ddaasshheedd--uunnddeerrssccoorree
             Set an attribute.  Any of the attributes may be prefixed with ‘no’ to unset.
             aaccss is the terminal alternate character set.

     aalliiggnn==lleefftt (or nnooaalliiggnn), aalliiggnn==cceennttrree, aalliiggnn==rriigghhtt
             Align text to the left, centre or right of the available space if appropriate.

     ffiillll==ccoolloouurr
             Fill the available space with a background colour if appropriate.

     lliisstt==oonn, lliisstt==ffooccuuss, lliisstt==lleefftt--mmaarrkkeerr, lliisstt==rriigghhtt--mmaarrkkeerr, nnoolliisstt
             Mark the position of the various window list components in the ssttaattuuss--ffoorrmmaatt op‐
             tion: lliisstt==oonn marks the start of the list; lliisstt==ffooccuuss is the part of the list
             that should be kept in focus if the entire list won't fit in the available space
             (typically the current window); lliisstt==lleefftt--mmaarrkkeerr and lliisstt==rriigghhtt--mmaarrkkeerr mark the
             text to be used to mark that text has been trimmed from the left or right of the
             list if there is not enough space.

     ppuusshh--ddeeffaauulltt, ppoopp--ddeeffaauulltt
             Store the current colours and attributes as the default or reset to the previous
             default.  A ppuusshh--ddeeffaauulltt affects any subsequent use of the ddeeffaauulltt term until a
             ppoopp--ddeeffaauulltt.  Only one default may be pushed (each ppuusshh--ddeeffaauulltt replaces the
             previous saved default).

     rraannggee==lleefftt, rraannggee==rriigghhtt, rraannggee==wwiinnddooww||XX, nnoorraannggee
             Mark a range in the ssttaattuuss--ffoorrmmaatt option.  rraannggee==lleefftt and rraannggee==rriigghhtt are the
             text used for the ‘StatusLeft’ and ‘StatusRight’ mouse keys.  rraannggee==wwiinnddooww||XX is
             the range for a window passed to the ‘Status’ mouse key, where ‘X’ is a window
             index.

     Examples are:

           fg=yellow bold underscore blink
           bg=black,fg=default,noreverse

NNAAMMEESS AANNDD TTIITTLLEESS
     ttmmuuxx distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have names, which may
     be used to specify them in targets and are displayed in the status line and various
     lists: the name is the ttmmuuxx identifier for a window or session.  Only panes have titles.
     A pane's title is typically set by the program running inside the pane using an escape
     sequence (like it would set the xterm(1) window title in X(7)).  Windows themselves do
     not have titles - a window's title is the title of its active pane.  ttmmuuxx itself may set
     the title of the terminal in which the client is running, see the sseett--ttiittlleess option.

     A session's name is set with the nneeww--sseessssiioonn and rreennaammee--sseessssiioonn commands.  A window's
     name is set with one of:

     1.      A command argument (such as --nn for nneeww--wwiinnddooww or nneeww--sseessssiioonn).

     2.      An escape sequence (if the aallllooww--rreennaammee option is turned on):

                   $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

     3.      Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the window's
             active pane.  See the aauuttoommaattiicc--rreennaammee option.

     When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title can be set via
     the title setting escape sequence, for example:

           $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

     It can also be modified with the sseelleecctt--ppaannee --TT command.

GGLLOOBBAALL AANNDD SSEESSSSIIOONN EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     When the server is started, ttmmuuxx copies the environment into the _g_l_o_b_a_l _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t; in
     addition, each session has a _s_e_s_s_i_o_n _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t.  When a window is created, the session
     and global environments are merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value from the
     session environment is used.  The result is the initial environment passed to the new
     process.

     The uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt session option may be used to update the session environment from
     the client when a new session is created or an old reattached.  ttmmuuxx also initialises
     the TMUX variable with some internal information to allow commands to be executed from
     inside, and the TERM variable with the correct terminal setting of ‘screen’.

     Variables in both session and global environments may be marked as hidden.  Hidden vari‐
     ables are not passed into the environment of new processes and instead can only be used
     by tmux itself (for example in formats, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section).

     Commands to alter and view the environment are:

     sseett--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt [--FFhhggrruu] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] _n_a_m_e [_v_a_l_u_e]
                   (alias: sseetteennvv)
             Set or unset an environment variable.  If --gg is used, the change is made in the
             global environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session environment for
             _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  If --FF is present, then _v_a_l_u_e is expanded as a format.  The --uu
             flag unsets a variable.  --rr indicates the variable is to be removed from the en‐
             vironment before starting a new process.  --hh marks the variable as hidden.

     sshhooww--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt [--hhggss] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] [_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e]
                   (alias: sshhoowweennvv)
             Display the environment for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n or the global environment with --gg.
             If _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e is omitted, all variables are shown.  Variables removed from the en‐
             vironment are prefixed with ‘-’.  If --ss is used, the output is formatted as a
             set of Bourne shell commands.  --hh shows hidden variables (omitted by default).

SSTTAATTUUSS LLIINNEE
     ttmmuuxx includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each ter‐
     minal.

     By default, the status line is enabled and one line in height (it may be disabled or
     made multiple lines with the ssttaattuuss session option) and contains, from left-to-right:
     the name of the current session in square brackets; the window list; the title of the
     active pane in double quotes; and the time and date.

     Each line of the status line is configured with the ssttaattuuss--ffoorrmmaatt option.  The default
     is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain dynamic
     content such as the time or output from a shell command, see the ssttaattuuss--lleefftt,
     ssttaattuuss--lleefftt--lleennggtthh, ssttaattuuss--rriigghhtt, and ssttaattuuss--rriigghhtt--lleennggtthh options below), and a central
     window list.  By default, the window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the
     windows present in the current session in ascending numerical order.  It may be cus‐
     tomised with the _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_s_t_a_t_u_s_-_f_o_r_m_a_t and _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_s_t_a_t_u_s_-_c_u_r_r_e_n_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t options.  The
     flag is one of the following symbols appended to the window name:

           SSyymmbbooll    MMeeaanniinngg
           *         Denotes the current window.
           -         Marks the last window (previously selected).
           #         Window activity is monitored and activity has been detected.
           !         Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the window.
           ~         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
           M         The window contains the marked pane.
           Z         The window's active pane is zoomed.

     The # symbol relates to the mmoonniittoorr--aaccttiivviittyy window option.  The window name is printed
     in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.

     The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status line
     using the ssttaattuuss--ssttyyllee session option and individual windows using the
     wwiinnddooww--ssttaattuuss--ssttyyllee window option.

     The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval
     may be controlled with the ssttaattuuss--iinntteerrvvaall session option.

     Commands related to the status line are as follows:

     ccoommmmaanndd--pprroommpptt [--11iikkNNTTWW] [--II _i_n_p_u_t_s] [--pp _p_r_o_m_p_t_s] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from inside ttmmuuxx to exe‐
             cute commands interactively.

             If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is specified, it is used as the command.  If present, --II is a comma-
             separated list of the initial text for each prompt.  If --pp is given, _p_r_o_m_p_t_s is
             a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise a sin‐
             gle prompt is displayed, constructed from _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e if it is present, or ‘:’ if
             not.

             Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and all
             occurrences of ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first prompt, all ‘%2’
             are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for further
             prompts.  Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).  ‘%%%’ is
             like ‘%%’ but any quotation marks are escaped.

             --11 makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this case the resulting input
             is a single character.  --kk is like --11 but the key press is translated to a key
             name.  --NN makes the prompt only accept numeric key presses.  --ii executes the
             command every time the prompt input changes instead of when the user exits the
             command prompt.  --TT tells ttmmuuxx that the prompt is for a target which affects
             what completions are offered when _T_a_b is pressed; --WW is similar but indicates
             the prompt is for a window.

             Display a menu on _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t.  _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e gives the target for any commands
             run from the menu.

             A menu is passed as a series of arguments: first the menu item name, second the
             key shortcut (or empty for none) and third the command to run when the menu item
             is chosen.  The name and command are formats, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S and _S_T_Y_L_E_S sec‐
             tions.  If the name begins with a hyphen (-), then the item is disabled (shown
             dim) and may not be chosen.  The name may be empty for a separator line, in
             which case both the key and command should be omitted.

             --TT is a format for the menu title (see _F_O_R_M_A_T_S).

             --xx and --yy give the position of the menu.  Both may be a row or column number, or
             one of the following special values:

             Each menu consists of items followed by a key shortcut shown in brackets.  If
             the menu is too large to fit on the terminal, it is not displayed.  Pressing the
             key shortcut chooses the corresponding item.  If the mouse is enabled and the
             menu is opened from a mouse key binding, releasing the mouse button with an item
             selected chooses that item and releasing the mouse button without an item se‐
             lected closes the menu.  --OO changes this behaviour so that the menu does not
             close when the mouse button is released without an item selected the menu is not
             closed and a mouse button must be clicked to choose an item.

             The following keys are also available:

             Display a message.  If --pp is given, the output is printed to stdout, otherwise
             it is displayed in the _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t status line for up to _d_e_l_a_y milliseconds.
             If _d_e_l_a_y is not given, the mmeessssaaggee--ttiimmee option is used; a delay of zero waits
             for a key press.  ‘N’ ignores key presses and closes only after the delay ex‐
             pires.  The format of _m_e_s_s_a_g_e is described in the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section; information
             is taken from _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e if --tt is given, otherwise the active pane.

             --vv prints verbose logging as the format is parsed and --aa lists the format vari‐
             ables and their values.

             --II forwards any input read from stdin to the empty pane given by _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e.

             Display a popup running _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d on _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t.  A popup is a rectangu‐
             lar box drawn over the top of any panes.  Panes are not updated while a popup is
             present.

             --EE closes the popup automatically when _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d exits.  Two --EE closes the
             popup only if _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d exited with success.

             --xx and --yy give the position of the popup, they have the same meaning as for the
             ddiissppllaayy--mmeennuu command.  --ww and --hh give the width and height - both may be a per‐
             centage (followed by ‘%’).  If omitted, half of the terminal size is used.

             The --CC flag closes any popup on the client.

BBUUFFFFEERRSS
     ttmmuuxx maintains a set of named _p_a_s_t_e _b_u_f_f_e_r_s.  Each buffer may be either explicitly or
     automatically named.  Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the
     sseett--bbuuffffeerr or llooaadd--bbuuffffeerr commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer with
     sseett--bbuuffffeerr --nn.  Automatically named buffers are given a name such as ‘buffer0001’,
     ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the bbuuffffeerr--lliimmiitt option is reached, the oldest automati‐
     cally named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named buffers are not subject to bbuuffffeerr--lliimmiitt
     and may be deleted with the ddeelleettee--bbuuffffeerr command.

     Buffers may be added using ccooppyy--mmooddee or the sseett--bbuuffffeerr and llooaadd--bbuuffffeerr commands, and
     pasted into a window using the ppaassttee--bbuuffffeerr command.  If a buffer command is used and no
     buffer is specified, the most recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.

     A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to
     2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the hhiissttoorryy--lliimmiitt option (see the
     sseett--ooppttiioonn command above).

     The buffer commands are as follows:

     cchhoooossee--bbuuffffeerr [--NNZZrr] [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--ff _f_i_l_t_e_r] [--KK _k_e_y_-_f_o_r_m_a_t] [--OO _s_o_r_t_-_o_r_d_e_r] [--tt

             Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from a
             list.  Each buffer is shown on one line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left in
             brackets allowing for immediate choice, or the list may be navigated and an item
             chosen or otherwise manipulated using the keys below.  --ZZ zooms the pane.  The
             following keys may be used in buffer mode:

                   KKeeyy    FFuunnccttiioonn
                   Enter  Paste selected buffer

                   Down   Select next buffer
                   C-s    Search by name or content
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if buffer is tagged
                   T      Tag no buffers
                   C-t    Tag all buffers
                   p      Paste selected buffer
                   P      Paste tagged buffers
                   d      Delete selected buffer
                   D      Delete tagged buffers
                   e      Open the buffer in an editor
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort field
                   r      Reverse sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and
             the result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "paste-buffer -b
             '%%'" is used.

             --OO specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘time’, ‘name’ or ‘size’.  --rr re‐
             verses the sort order.  --ff specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format -
             if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is
             shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  --FF specifies
             the format for each item in the list and --KK a format for each shortcut key; both
             are evaluated once for each line.  --NN starts without the preview.  This command
             works only if at least one client is attached.

             Delete the buffer named _b_u_f_f_e_r_-_n_a_m_e, or the most recently added automatically
             named buffer if not specified.

                   (alias: llssbb)
             List the global buffers.  --FF specifies the format of each line and --ff a filter.
             Only buffers for which the filter is true are shown.  See the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.

     When a ttmmuuxx client detaches, it prints a message.  This may be one of:

     detached (from session ...)
             The client was detached normally.

     detached and SIGHUP
             The client was detached and its parent sent the SIGHUP signal (for example with
             ddeettaacchh--cclliieenntt --PP).

     lost tty
             The client's tty(4) or pty(4) was unexpectedly destroyed.

     terminated
             The client was killed with SIGTERM.

     too far behind
             The client is in control mode and became unable to keep up with the data from
             ttmmuuxx.

     exited  The server exited when it had no sessions.

     server exited
             The server exited when it received SIGTERM.

     server exited unexpectedly
             The server crashed or otherwise exited without telling the client the reason.

TTEERRMMIINNFFOO EEXXTTEENNSSIIOONNSS
     ttmmuuxx understands some unofficial extensions to terminfo(5).  It is not normally neces‐
     sary to set these manually, instead the tteerrmmiinnaall--ffeeaattuurreess option should be used.

     _A_X      An existing extension that tells ttmmuuxx the terminal supports default colours.

     _B_i_d_i    Tell ttmmuuxx that the terminal supports the VTE bidirectional text extensions.

     _C_s, _C_r  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used to
             set the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the default cursor
             colour.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor colour
             from inside ttmmuuxx:

                   $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

     _C_m_g_, _C_l_m_g_, _D_s_m_g, _E_n_m_g
             Set, clear, disable or enable DECSLRM margins.  These are set automatically if
             the terminal reports it is _V_T_4_2_0 compatible.

     _D_s_b_p, _E_n_b_p
             Disable and enable bracketed paste.  These are set automatically if the _X_T capa‐
             bility is present.

     _D_s_e_k_s, _E_n_e_k_s
             Disable and enable extended keys.

     _D_s_f_c_s, _E_n_f_c_s
             Disable and enable focus reporting.  These are set automatically if the _X_T capa‐
             bility is present.

     _S_m_o_l    Enable the overline attribute.

     _S_m_u_l_x   Set a styled underscore.  The single parameter is one of: 0 for no underscore, 1
             for normal underscore, 2 for double underscore, 3 for curly underscore, 4 for
             dotted underscore and 5 for dashed underscore.

     _S_e_t_u_l_c, _o_l
             Set the underscore colour or reset to the default.  The argument is (red *
             65536) + (green * 256) + blue where each is between 0 and 255.

     _S_s, _S_e  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to
             change the cursor to an underline:

                   $ printf '\033[4 q'

             If _S_e is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style in‐
             stead.

     _S_y_n_c    Start (parameter is 1) or end (parameter is 2) a synchronized update.

     _T_c      Indicate that the terminal supports the ‘direct colour’ RGB escape sequence (for
             example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

             If supported, this is used for the initialize colour escape sequence (which may
             be enabled by adding the ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’ capabilities to the ttmmuuxx terminfo(5)
             entry).

             This is equivalent to the _R_G_B terminfo(5) capability.

     _M_s      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).  See the
             _s_e_t_-_c_l_i_p_b_o_a_r_d option above and the xterm(1) man page.

     _X_T      This is an existing extension capability that tmux uses to mean that the termi‐
             nal supports the xterm(1) title set sequences and to automatically set some of
             the capabilities above.

CCOONNTTRROOLL MMOODDEE
     ttmmuuxx offers a textual interface called _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _m_o_d_e.  This allows applications to commu‐
     nicate with ttmmuuxx using a simple text-only protocol.

     In control mode, a client sends ttmmuuxx commands or command sequences terminated by new‐
     lines on standard input.  Each command will produce one block of output on standard out‐
     put.  An output block consists of a _%_b_e_g_i_n line followed by the output (which may be
     empty).  The output block ends with a _%_e_n_d or _%_e_r_r_o_r.  _%_b_e_g_i_n and matching _%_e_n_d or
     _%_e_r_r_o_r have two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and command number.
     For example:

           %begin 1363006971 2
           0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
           %end 1363006971 2

     The rreeffrreesshh--cclliieenntt --CC command may be used to set the size of a client in control mode.

     In control mode, ttmmuuxx outputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside an
     output block.

     The following notifications are defined:

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     When ttmmuuxx is started, it inspects the following environment variables:

     EDITOR    If the command specified in this variable contains the string ‘vi’ and VISUAL
               is unset, use vi-style key bindings.  Overridden by the mmooddee--kkeeyyss and
               ssttaattuuss--kkeeyyss options.

     HOME      The user's login directory.  If unset, the passwd(5) database is consulted.

     LC_CTYPE  The character encoding locale(1).  It is used for two separate purposes.  For
               output to the terminal, UTF-8 is used if the --uu option is given or if LC_CTYPE
               contains "UTF-8" or "UTF8".  Otherwise, only ASCII characters are written and
               non-ASCII characters are replaced with underscores (‘_’).  For input, ttmmuuxx al‐
               ways runs with a UTF-8 locale.  If en_US.UTF-8 is provided by the operating
               system it is used and LC_CTYPE is ignored for input.  Otherwise, LC_CTYPE
               tells ttmmuuxx what the UTF-8 locale is called on the current system.  If the lo‐
               cale specified by LC_CTYPE is not available or is not a UTF-8 locale, ttmmuuxx ex‐
               its with an error message.

     LC_TIME   The date and time format locale(1).  It is used for locale-dependent
               strftime(3) format specifiers.

     PWD       The current working directory to be set in the global environment.  This may
               be useful if it contains symbolic links.  If the value of the variable does
               not match the current working directory, the variable is ignored and the re‐
               sult of getcwd(3) is used instead.

     SHELL     The absolute path to the default shell for new windows.  See the ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll
               option for details.

     TMUX_TMPDIR
               The parent directory of the directory containing the server sockets.  See the
               --LL option for details.

     VISUAL    If the command specified in this variable contains the string ‘vi’, use vi-
               style key bindings.  Overridden by the mmooddee--kkeeyyss and ssttaattuuss--kkeeyyss options.

FFIILLEESS
     ~/.tmux.conf       Default ttmmuuxx configuration file.
     /etc/tmux.conf     System-wide configuration file.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To create a new ttmmuuxx session running vi(1):

           $ tmux new-session vi

     Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session, this is nneeww:

           $ tmux new vi

     Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.  If there are
     several options, they are listed:

           $ tmux n
           ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

     Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’ (Ctrl followed
     by the ‘b’ key followed by the ‘c’ key).

     Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’ (to select window
     1), and so on; ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and ‘C-b p’ to select the previous
     window.

     A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an external event such as ssh(1) discon‐
     nection) and reattached with:

           $ tmux attach-session

     Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be
     used to navigate the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.

     Commands to be run when the ttmmuuxx server is started may be placed in the _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f
     configuration file.  Common examples include:

     Changing the default prefix key:

           set-option -g prefix C-a
           unbind-key C-b
           bind-key C-a send-prefix

     Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

           set-option -g status off
           set-option -g status-style bg=blue

     Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of inac‐
     tivity:

           set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
           set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

     Creating new key bindings:

           bind-key b set-option status
           bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
           bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"

DataTau launches as a Hacker News for data scientists


* Coursera
* Andrew Ng's Machine learning class
* Bill Howe's Intro to Data Science
* Udacity
* Stats 101
* Intro to AI I'm not familiar with Udacity's new data science courses, but I think Udacity has the best course presentation generally.
* The NLTK book (http://nltk.org/book/) has a lot if good info, even if you're not doing NLP.
* scikit-learn also has some good machine learning tutorials
* A Programmers Guide to Datamining (http://guidetodatamining.com/) has some good practical advice and is very easy to read. It's hard to recommend what will really help someone without knowing their background.

Conceptually, the REPL is similar to SSH. In the same way that you can use SSH to interact with a remote server, the Clojure REPL allows you to monkey around with a running Clojure process. This can be very powerful, as you can even attach a REPL to a live, production app and modify your program as it runs. For now, though, we'll be using the REPL to build our knowledge of Clojure syntax and semantics.

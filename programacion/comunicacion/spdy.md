SPDY (pronounced speedy)[1] is an open networking protocol developed primarily at Google for transporting web content.[1] As of July 2012, the group developing SPDY has stated publicly that it is working toward standardization (available as an Internet Draft).[2] The first draft of HTTP 2.0 is using SPDY as the working base for its specification draft and editing.[3] Implementations of SPDY exist in Chromium,[4] Mozilla Firefox,[5] Opera,[6] Amazon Silk and Internet Explorer.[7] SPDY is similar to HTTP, with particular goals of reducing web page load latency and improving web security. SPDY achieves reduced latency through compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.[1] The name "SPDY" is a trademark of Google, and is not an acronym.[8]

Event Processing with Esper and NEsper

Esper is a component for complex event processing (CEP), available for Java as Esper, and for .NET as NEsper.

Esper and NEsper enable rapid development of applications that process large volumes of incoming messages or events, regardless of whether incoming messages are historical or real-time in nature. Esper and NEsper filter and analyze events in various ways, and respond to conditions of interest with minimal latency.

Esper and Event Processing Language (EPL) provide a highly scalable, memory-efficient, in-memory computing, SQL-standard, minimal latency, real-time streaming Big Data processing engine for medium to high-velocity and high-variety data.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julia’s built-in package manager at a rapid pace. IJulia, a collaboration between the IPython and Julia communities, provides a powerful browser-based graphical notebook interface to Julia.

Designed for parallelism and distributed computation
Good performance, approaching that of statically-compiled languages like C
extensive mathematical function library

Los de ETSY dicen que es prometedor por su posibilidad de multihilo y capacidad matemática potente. La pega es que era muy joven.

(16/12/2013) 1.0 will come in 1-3 years. It's really hard to say. I think language will largely stabilize in 1 year.

# A note on naming conventions in Julia:
#
# * Names of variables are in lower case, with word separation indicated by
#   underscores ('\_').
#
# * Names of Types begin with a capital letter and word separation is shown
#   with CamelCase instead of underscores.
#
# * Names of functions and macros are in lower case, without underscores.
#
# * Functions that modify their inputs have names that end in !. These
#   functions are sometimes called mutating functions or in-place functions.

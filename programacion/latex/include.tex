% \include{filename} essentially does a \clearpage before and after \input{filename}, together with some magic to switch to another .aux file, and omit the inclusion at all if you have an \includeonly without the filename in the argument. This is primarily useful when you have a big project on a slow computer; changing one of the include targets won't force you to regenerate the outputs of all the rest

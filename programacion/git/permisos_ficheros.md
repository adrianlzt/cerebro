Git doesn't really store the full mode of the file. It really only cares about one single bit, the x (executable) bit. If the x bit is on, git says that a file is mode 100755. If the x bit is off, git says that the same file is now mode 100644

El bit importante es el de ejecuci√≥n del usuario, el resto dan igual.

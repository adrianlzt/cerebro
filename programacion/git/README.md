## Installing

Check out [how to install jx](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/install/).

## Getting Started

Please check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/) on how to:

* [create new Kubernetes clusters with Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/create-cluster/)
* [install Jenkins X on existing Kubernetes clusters](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/managing-jx/old/install-on-cluster/)

Then [what to do next when you have Jenkins X installed](https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/next/).

## Welcome to the Jenkins X Community

We value respect and inclusiveness and follow the [CDF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions.

Weâ€™d love to talk with you about Jenkins X and are happy to help if you have any questions.

Talk to us on our slack channels, which are part of the Kubernetes slack. Join Kubernetes slack [here](https://slack.k8s.io/) and find us on our channels:

* [#jenkins-x-user](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C9MBGQJRH) for users of Jenkins X

* [#jenkins-x-dev](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C9LTHT2BB) for developers of Jenkins X

Find out more about our bi-weekly office hours, where we discuss all things Jenkins X, and other events [here](https://jenkins-x.io/community/).

## Getting Help

To find out the available commands type:

    jx

Or to get help on a specific command, say, `create` then type:

    jx help create

You can also browse the [jx command reference documentation](https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx/).

## Reference

* [Command Line Reference](https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx/#jx)
  
  
## Opening Consoles

To open the Jenkins console try:

    jx console
    
Or to open other consoles:

    jx open foo
    
If you do not know the name:

    jx open
    

## Tail logs

To tail the logs of anything running on Kubernetes (jenkins or your own applications) type.

    jx logs
    
Which prompts you for the deployment to log then tails the logs of the newest pod for an app.

You can filter the list of deployments via:

    jx logs -f cheese

Then if there's only one deployment with a name that contains `cheese` then it'll tail the logs of the latest pod or will prompt you to choose the exact deployment to use.

## Remote shells

You can open a remote shell inside any pods container via the `rsh` command:

    jx rsh
    
Or to open a shell inside a pod named foo:

    jx rsh foo

Pass `-c` to specify the container name. e.g. to open a shell in a maven build pod:

    jx rsh -c maven maven

## Importing or Creating apps

To import an application from the current directory:

    jx import
    
Or to create a new Spring Boot application from scratch:

    jx create spring
    
e.g. to create a new WebMVC and Spring Boot Actuator microservice try this:

    jx create spring -d web -d actuator
        
    
## Starting builds

To start a pipeline using a specific name try:

    jx start pipeline myorg/myrepo

Or to pick the pipeline to start:

    jx start pipeline

If you know part of the name of the pipeline to run you can filter the list via:

    jx start pipeline -f thingy

You can start and tail the build log via:
		
    jx start pipeline -t

## Viewing Apps and Environments

To view environments for a team:

    jx get env
    
To view the application versions across environments:

    jx get version
            
## Manual promotions

Typically we setup Environments to use _automatic_ promotion so that the CI / CD pipelines will automatically promote versions through the available Environments using the CI / CD Pipeline.

However if you wish to manually promote a version to an environment you can use the following command:

    jx promote myapp -e prod 
    
Or if you wish to use a custom namespace:   

    jx promote myapp -n my-dummy-namespace
 
## Switching Environments

The `jx` CLI tool uses the same Kubernetes cluster and namespace context as `kubectl`. 

You can switch Environments via:

    jx env
    
Or change it via:

    jx env staging
    jx env prod
    
To display the current environment without trying to change it:

    jx env -b

To view all the environments type:

    jx get env
    
You can create or edit environments too:

    jx create env
    
    jx edit env staging
    
You can switch namespaces in the same way via:

    jx ns

or

    jx ns awesome-staging    

## Switching Clusters

If you have multiple Kubernetes clusters then you can switch between them via:

    jx ctx

**Note** that changing the namespace ,environment or cluster changes the current context for **ALL** shells!

### Sub shells

So if you want to work temporarily with, say, the production cluster we highly recommend you use a sub shell for that.

    jx shell my-prod-context
    
Or to pick the context to use for the sub shell:

    jx shell 

Then your bash prompt will be updated to reflect that you are in a different context and/or namespace. Any changes to the namespace, environment or context will be local to the current shell only!    

### Setting your prompt

You can use the `jx prompt` to configure your CLI prompt to display the current team and environment you are working within:          
                                            
		# Enable the prompt for bash
		PS1="[\u@\h \W \$(jx prompt)]\$ "

		# Enable the prompt for zsh
		PROMPT='$(jx prompt)'$PROMPT

**Note** that the prompt is updated automatically for you via the `jx shell` command too.

### Bash completion

On a Mac to enable bash completion try:

    jx completion bash > ~/.jx/bash
    source ~/.jx/bash   
    
Or try:

    source <(jx completion bash)

For more help try:

    jx help completion bash
           
## Addons

We are adding a number of addon capabilities to Jenkins X. To add or remove addons use the `jx create addon` or `jx delete addon` commands.

For example to add the [Gitea Git server](https://gitea.io/en-US/) to your Jenkins X installation try:

    jx create addon gitea

This will:

* install the Gitea Helm chart.
* add Gitea as a Git server (via the `jx create git server gitea` command).
* create a new user in Gitea (via the `jx create git user -n gitea` command).
* create a new Git API token in Gitea (via the `jx create git token -n gitea -p password username` command).

## Troubleshooting

We have tried to collate common issues here with work arounds. If your issue isn't listed here please [let us know](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/new).

aptly is a swiss army knife for Debian repository management: it allows you to mirror remote repositories, manage local package repositories, take snapshots, pull new versions of packages along with dependencies, publish as Debian repository. You can try it right now just for free.

aptly is available both as CLI tool and HTTP REST service.

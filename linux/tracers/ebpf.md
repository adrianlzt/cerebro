Es el strace para linux
These are coming to Linux in the 4.x series


The extended Berkeley Packet Filter is an in-kernel virtual machine that can run programs on events, efficiently (JIT). It's likely to eventually provide in-kernel programming for ftrace and perf_events, and to enhance other tracers. It's currently being developed by Alexei Starovoitov, and isn't fully integrated yet, but there's enough in-kernel (as of 4.1) for some impressive tools: eg, latency heat maps of block device I/O. For reference, see the BPF slides from Alexei, and his eBPF samples.

One of the more interesting features in this cycle is the ability to attach eBPF programs (user-defined, sandboxed bytecode executed by the kernel) to kprobes. This allows user-defined instrumentation on a live kernel image that can never crash, hang or interfere with the kernel negatively.

use Amazon EC2 to host a shared screen session
 screenbin uses Amazon's EC2 cloud to dynamically instantiate an Ubuntu
 instance in the cloud, install a specified list of ssh keys, and launch a
 shared screen session as a guest user. In this manner, screenbin is a
 collaborative tool like pastebin, or gobby, but provides a shared shell
 environment.


apt-get install screenbin

SASL is a framework for authentication mechanism negotiation.  A server can advertise one or more authentication mechanisms to clients, and the two can agree on which one to use.  (Most mail servers use this.)  It is not uncommon to have SASL configured to allow the use of PAM.  See Cyrus SASL for System Administrators and RFC-4422 for more information on SASL.

Major page fault: A more severe memory latency is a major page fault. These can occur when the system has to synchronize memory buffers with the disk, swap memory pages belonging to other processes, or undertake any other Input/Output activity to free memory. This occurs when the processor references a virtual memory address that has not had a physical page allocated to it. The reference to an empty page causes the processor to execute a fault, and instructs the kernel code to allocate a page and return, all of which increases latency dramatically.

Minor page fault: A potential source of memory latency is called a minor page fault. They are created when a process attempts to access a portion of memory before it has been initialized. In this case, the system will need to perform some operations to fill the memory maps or other management structures. The severity of a minor page fault can depend on system load and other factors, but they are usually short and have a negligable impact.

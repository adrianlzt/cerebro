The iostat command is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation to their average transfer rates. The  iostat  command  generates  reports that can be used to change system configuration to better balance the input/output load between physical disks.

The first report generated by the iostat command provides statistics concerning the time since the system was booted, unless the -y option is  used  (in  this case, this first report is omitted). Each subsequent report covers the time since the previous report.


Estadísticas extendidas del disco cada 5 segundos (si ponemos otro numero al final será el número de veces que se ejecutará el iostat)
iostat -dhNtxz 5

Si queremos ver particiones determinadas: iostat -dhNtxz 5 /dev/sda1 /dev/sda5

  -d Display the device utilization report.
  -h Make the Device Utilization Report easier to read by a human.
  -N Display the registered device mapper names for any device mapper devices.  Useful for viewing LVM2 statistics.
  -t Print the time for each report displayed
  -x Display extended statistics
  -z Tell iostat to omit output for any devices for which there was no activity during the sample period

rrqm/s: The number of read requests merged per second that were queued to the device.
wrqm/s: The number of write requests merged per second that were queued to the device.
r/s: The number (after merges) of read requests completed per second for the device.
w/s: The number (after merges) of write requests completed per second for the device.
rkB/s: The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from the device per second.
wkB/s: The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) written to the device per second.
avgrq-sz: The average size (in sectors) of the requests that were issued to the device.
avgqu-sz: The average queue length of the requests that were issued to the device.
await: average time (milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the device to be served. Includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.
r_await: average time (milliseconds) for read requests issued to the device to be served. Includes time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.
w_await: average  time (ms) for write requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them
svctm: WARNING! Do not trust this  field  any  more. This field will be removed in a future sysstat version.
%util: Percentage of CPU time during which I/O requests were issued to the device(BW utilization for the device).Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100%

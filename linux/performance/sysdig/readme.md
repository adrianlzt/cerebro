Sysdig is a new Linux system troubleshooting tool, described as a combination of strace, tcpdump and lsof. The examples are pretty impressive and you can imagine lots of tools you could build on top of this.

Sysdig is built to run in production. By running as little code as possible in the kernel, sysdig minimizes performance overhead and the risk of crashes.

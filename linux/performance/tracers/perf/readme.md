Perf
https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page

This is the wiki page for the perf performance counters subsystem in Linux. Performance counters are CPU hardware registers that count hardware events such as instructions executed, cache-misses suffered, or branches mispredicted. They form a basis for profiling applications to trace dynamic control flow and identify hotspots.
perf provides rich generalized abstractions over hardware specific capabilities. Among others, it provides per task, per CPU and per-workload counters, sampling on top of these and source code event annotation.


Perf is natively supported in many popular Linux distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (since its version 6 released in 2010)[11] and Debian (since its Squeeze version released in 2011).[12]

Available from Linux kernel version 2.6.31

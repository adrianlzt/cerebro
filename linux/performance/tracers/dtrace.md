dtrace4linux is mostly one man's part-time effort (Paul Fox) to port Sun DTrace to Linux. It's impressive, and some providers work, but it's some ways from complete, and is more of an experimental tool (unsafe). I think concern over licensing has left people wary of contributing: it will likely never make it into the Linux kernel, as Sun released DTrace under the CDDL license; Paul's approach to this is to make it an add-on. I'd love to see DTrace on Linux and this project finished, and thought I'd spend time helping it finish when I joined Netflix. However, I've been spending time using the built-in tracers, ftrace and perf_events, instead.

Oracle Linux DTrace is a serious effort to bring DTrace to Linux, specifically Oracle Linux. Various releases over the years have shown steady progress. The developers have even spoken about improving the DTrace test suite, which shows a promising attitude to the project. Many useful providers have already been completed: syscall, profile, sdt, proc, sched, and USDT. I'm still waiting for fbt (function boundary tracing, for kernel dynamic tracing), which will be awesome on the Linux kernel. Its ultimate success will hinge on whether it's enough to tempt people to run Oracle Linux (and pay for support). Another catch is that it may not be entirely open source: the kernel components are, but I've yet to see the user-level code.

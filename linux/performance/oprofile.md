Profile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of profiling all running code at low overhead. OProfile is released under the GNU GPL.


Una de las features:
Single process profiling
Application developers will find the single process profiling feature very convenient since it does not require root authority, and profile data is collected only for the specified process (or command). This method has the added benefit of "following" fork/execs and collecting profile information on those child processes as well. Note: This method of profiling requires a kernel version of 2.6.31 or higher.

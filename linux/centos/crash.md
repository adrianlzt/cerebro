Kernel crash and live system analysis utility

The core analysis suite is a self-contained tool that can be used to investigate either live systems, kernel core dumps created from the netdump, diskdump and kdump packages from Red Hat Linux, the mcore kernel patch offered by Mission Critical Linux, or the LKCD kernel patch.

#
# solid-pop3d needs to be compiled with --enable-logextend to support
# IP addresses in log messages.
#
# solid-pop3d-0.15/src/main.c contains all authentication errors
# except for PAM authentication messages ( src/authenticate.c )
#
# A pam authentication failure message (note no IP for rhost).

Supermon is a high-speed cluster monitoring system that emphasizes LowPerturbation, high SamplingRates, and an extensible DataProtocol and ProgrammingInterface. It has been shown to scale from the most basic single processor machines to large scale, 1024 (2048) processor clusters. Although it is most frequently used on Linux-based clusters, the infrastructure is in no way limited to this operating system provided that data can be extracted from the operating system and presented in the correct format.

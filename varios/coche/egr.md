This system recirculates part of the exhaust gases to the intake under certain particular operating
conditions.
This lowers peak temperature in the combustion chamber so as to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx)
formation. The engine control unit recirculates a portion of the exhaust gases taken from the exhaust
manifold back to the engine intake.

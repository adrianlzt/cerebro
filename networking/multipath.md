The Multipath Helper Lab walks you through the process of creating an optimal configuration for multipath devices on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. Multipath Helper generates an installation script for you to run on your server for easy and consistent configuration of your multipath devices with custom aliases, device blacklists, and settings for the characteristics of individual multipath devices.

Redir redirects tcp connections coming in to a local port to a specified address/port combination.

A port redirector, used to forward incoming connections to somewhere else. by far the cleanest piece of code here, because someone else liked it enough to fix it.


redir --lport=8002 --cport=2222
8002 -> 2222

Etherpuppet is a small program for Linux that will create a virtual interface (TUN/TAP) on one machine from the ethernet interface of another machine through a TCP connection. Everything seen by the real interface will be seen by the virtual one. Everything sent to the virtual interface will be emitted by the real one.

"For the text-to-speech (TTS) component, I selected Bert-VITS2. This project boasts a vibrant community with many individuals creating personalized voices using the framework. The results are impressive, and it requires only a few minutes of training material to produce a high-quality personalized voice, which made it an ideal choice for this endeavor. BTW, it even supports multi languages!"

Keras: Deep Learning library for Theano and TensorFlow
Programar neuronal networks de manera sencilla
  
  blencdr 1 day ago [-]
  From a programmer background with very few knowledge of mathematics, keras helped me to create some quite efficient CNN without all the code needed by tensorflow.
  This simplicity implies limits for advanced users, but the tool is fantastic to apprehend deep learning.

Learn TensorFlow and deep learning, without a Ph.D. (cloud.google.com)
This is probably the most effective 3 hours I have spent trying to get my head around Tensor Flow (and NN in general somewhat). Hell I even get what CNN and RNN's -are- now.

Aparecen muchos recursos, entre ellos estos:

Within a few hours of starting the course you'll have submitted an entry into the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats competition that scores in the top 50% of entries and achieves 97% accuracy. It's designed for coders who don't have a PHD in math. It's a very top-down approach, where you only get into mathematical details once you understand the high level models being used


Udacity / Google course by Vanhoucke I think is the most popular for learning TensorFlow proper - https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730
Definitely recommended. It's the best course available in a 3 month format.

Andrew Ng’s class on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is quite good
it’s accessible with a bit of basic calculus knowledge (simple single variable derivatives and partial derivatives are all you need) and basic linear algebra (like, matrix multiplication). The whole class took me around 30 hours to get through, so if you’re determined, you could probably finish it in 2-3 weeks even if you’re pretty busy.

El propio autor en un tweet: My Coursera MOOC "Neural Networks for Machine Learning" was prepared in 2012 and is now seriously out of date so I have asked them to discontinue the course. But the lectures are still a good introduction to many of the basic ideas

Machine Learning:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E: Andrew Ng's machine Learning course, the recommended entry point by most people
* https://mlcourse.ai/ : More kaggle focused, but also more modern and has interesting projects


Deep Learning
* https://www.fast.ai/ - Very hands-on, begin with " Practical Deep Learning for Coders" and then "Advanced Deep Learning for coders"
* https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning : More bottom-up approach, helps to understand the theory better

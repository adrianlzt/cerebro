Keras: Deep Learning library for Theano and TensorFlow
Programar neuronal networks de manera sencilla
  
  blencdr 1 day ago [-]
  From a programmer background with very few knowledge of mathematics, keras helped me to create some quite efficient CNN without all the code needed by tensorflow.
  This simplicity implies limits for advanced users, but the tool is fantastic to apprehend deep learning.

Learn TensorFlow and deep learning, without a Ph.D. (cloud.google.com)
This is probably the most effective 3 hours I have spent trying to get my head around Tensor Flow (and NN in general somewhat). Hell I even get what CNN and RNN's -are- now.

Aparecen muchos recursos, entre ellos estos:

Within a few hours of starting the course you'll have submitted an entry into the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats competition that scores in the top 50% of entries and achieves 97% accuracy. It's designed for coders who don't have a PHD in math. It's a very top-down approach, where you only get into mathematical details once you understand the high level models being used


Udacity / Google course by Vanhoucke I think is the most popular for learning TensorFlow proper - https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730
Definitely recommended. It's the best course available in a 3 month format.

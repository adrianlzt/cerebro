coding assistant that works with any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible LLM API, and allows you to switch models at will mid-conversation when a particular model gets stuck. Octo can optionally use (and we recommend using) ML models we custom-trained and open-sourced (1, 2) to automatically handle tool call and code edit failures from the main coding models you're working with: the autofix models work with any coding LLM

```bash
npx octofriend

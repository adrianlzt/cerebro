GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting text inputs and emitting text outputs today, with image inputs coming in the future) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of our previous models, thanks to its broader general knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. Like gpt-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 is optimized for chat but works well for traditional completions tasks both using the Chat Completions API.





# GPT-3.5-turbo
max tokens: 4,096
$0.002 / 1K tokens

Can understand and generate natural language or code. Our most capable and cost effective model in the GPT-3.5 family is gpt-3.5-turbo which has been optimized for chat but works well for traditional completions tasks as well.

GPT-3.5 Turbo may be a better choice for tasks that require high accuracy in math or 0 shot classification and sentiment analysis, while Davinci-003 may be more suitable for tasks that require concise responses or perform better with k-shot examples

gpt-3.5-turbo, leaves the role too easily, and tends to ignore the “system” content instructions.



# Davinci-003
max tokens: 2049
$0.020 / 1K tokens

Most capable GPT-3 model. Can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality.

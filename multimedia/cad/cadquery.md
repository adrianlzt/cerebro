A python parametric CAD scripting framework based on OCCT

CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python library for building parametric 3D CAD models. It has several goals:
  Build models with scripts that are as close as possible to how youâ€™d describe the object to a human, using a standard, already established programming language
  Create parametric models that can be very easily customized by end users
  Output high quality CAD formats like STEP, AMF and 3MF in addition to traditional STL
  Provide a non-proprietary, plain text model format that can be edited and executed with only a web browser

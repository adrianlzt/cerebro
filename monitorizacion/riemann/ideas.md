We’ve barely scratched the surface of Riemann’s capabilities with this introduction. From here we could configure a variety of streams, matching events by service or host, and convert our events into summaries, metrics and collections.4 We can take alerting actions (email, PagerDuty) based on everything from failed services (replace Nagios anyone?), to metric thresholds, or even Holt-Winters anomaly detection. We can also send data onto longer-term storage or into other tools like Graphite. The Riemann HOWTO (http://riemann.io/howto.html) has a number of examples and ideas to help you build your Riemann environment further. I really recommend taking a look at Riemann if you’re interested in where modern monitoring is headed.

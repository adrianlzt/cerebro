Thruk Monitoring Webinterface

Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface which currently
supports Nagios, Icinga and Shinken as backend using the Livestatus
API. It is designed to be a 'dropin' replacement and covers almost
100% of the original features plus adds additional enhancements for
large installations and increased usability.

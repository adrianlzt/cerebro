dynamic and adaptive thresholds for Nagios

Bischeck is an open source project with the goal to provide monitoring of applications and processes with dynamic behavior. By caching collected monitored data, Bischeck can create thresholds based on any combination of the collected data, enabling baselines that are dynamic and adaptive to business load. Threshold profiles can also be defined for different time periods, like day of month and week, to support different expected baselines. This is equally applicable if the need is to monitor your average utilization of all virtual machines or the expected order flow to your business system.

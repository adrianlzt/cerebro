Esper is a component for complex event processing (CEP) and event series analysis, available for Java as Esper, and for .NET as NEsper.
Esper and NEsper enable rapid development of applications that process large volumes of incoming messages or events, regardless of whether incoming messages are historical or real-time in nature. Esper and NEsper filter and analyze events in various ways, and respond to conditions of interest.
Esper and Event Processing Language (EPL) provide a highly scalable, memory-efficient, in-memory computing, SQL-standard, minimal latency, real-time streaming-capable Big Data processing engine for historical data, or medium to high-velocity data and high-variety data.

esperr: Streaming event processing for R 

The esperr package for R incorporates the Esper framework and implements an R-language interface to its XML and Java bean event API. Events are defined by Java objects or by XML documents that follow an XML schema definition (XSD) document. The package includes example schema and events. 

R is not particularly well-suited to handling streaming data, Esper is.
Esper doesn't provide sophisticated analysis tools, R does.

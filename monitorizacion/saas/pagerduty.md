Pagerduty is all about the alerts side of monitoring. Most of the other SaaS tools weâ€™ve chosen integrate with it so we can make sure we get actionable emails and SMS messages to the right people at the right time. Our plan costs $18 per person per month, so lets say we have 30 people at a cost of $540 per month.

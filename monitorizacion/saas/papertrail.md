Papertrail is all about logs. Simple setup your servers with syslog and Papertrail will collect, analyze and store all your log messages. You get a browser based interface, search tools and the ability to setup alerts. We like lots of logs so weâ€™ll have a plan for 2 weeks of search, 1 year archive and 100GB month of log traffic. That all costs $575 per month.

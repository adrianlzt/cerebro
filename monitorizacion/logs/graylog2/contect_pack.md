Content packs are bundles of Graylog input, extractor, stream, dashboard, and output configurations that can provide full support for a data source. Some content packs are shipped with Graylog by default and some are available from the website. Content packs that were downloaded from here can be imported using the Graylog web interface.

You can load and even create own content packs from the System -> Content Packs section of your Graylog web interface.

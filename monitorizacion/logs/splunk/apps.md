You can extend Splunk's capability by installing apps. Splunk apps come with searches, reports, and graphs about specific products that are common to most IT departments. These searches, reports, and graphs reduce the amount of time it takes to glean real value from installing and running the Splunk platform.

It's important to understand how precedence works. In many cases, if there is a configuration file conflict, Splunk gives priority to an app's configuration file. In some situations, installing an app might inadvertently override a setting in a configuration file in the core platform, which might lead to undesired results in data collection. Be sure to read the previously mentioned topic thoroughly for details.

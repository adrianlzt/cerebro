Splunk on Splunk (S.o.S) is an app that turns Splunk's diagnostic tools inward to analyze and troubleshoot problems in your Splunk environment. It contains views and tools that allow you to do the following: 
* View, search and compare Splunk configuration files. 
* Detect and expose errors and anomalies in your installation, including inspection of crash logs. 
* Measure indexing performance and expose event processing bottlenecks. 
* View details of scheduler and user-driven search activity. 
* Analyze data volume metrics captured by Splunk. 
The SoS app has been developed primarily by the Splunk Support team, with the help of Splunk Dev, Splunk Docs, and Sideview LLC (http://sideviewapps.com).

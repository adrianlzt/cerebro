Parse log files, generate metrics for Graphite and Ganglia

Logster is a utility for reading log files and generating metrics in Graphite or Ganglia or Amazon CloudWatch. It is ideal for visualizing trends of events that are occurring in your application/system/error logs. For example, you might use logster to graph the number of occurrences of HTTP response code that appears in your web server logs.

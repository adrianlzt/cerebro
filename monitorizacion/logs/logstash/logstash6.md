Logstash 6.0.0 is still very much a “work-in-progress,” but the information Elastic has released so far talks of a feature called Logstash Intermediate Representation (LIR) that will allow users to “manipulate and introspect” Logstash configurations before and during runtime.

While this description is a bit ambiguous, it seems that LIR will support a graphical depiction of Logstash logging pipelines within Kibana.

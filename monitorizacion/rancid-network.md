Really awesome tool to monitor network device's configuration & maintain history of changes. It monitors a router's (or more generally a device's) configuration, including software and hardware (cards, serial numbers, etc) and uses CVS (Concurrent Version System) or Subversion to maintain history of changes. Great tool for Cicso Juniper, and foundry users.

WebRockit uses a headless web browser to measure how fast web pages load, relative to what a real user might experience. WebRockit also captures interesting metrics about the page load (time to first byte, number of assets, size of response, etc) and can draw some time-series graphs using that data. WebRockit is intended for periodic collection of this data

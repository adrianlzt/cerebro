This project started with the objective of identifying hotspots across a large number of systems
I wanted to try and pack as many horizon charts into as compact a visual frame as possible, while still allowing the reader to discern one metric from another
It's great for experimentation but I would never recommend it as your primary dashboard interface. Nevertheless, I think it serves an important purpose in identifying hotspots and host activity patterns

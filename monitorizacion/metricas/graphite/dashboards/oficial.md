The Dashboard interface is the tool of choice for displaying more than one graph at a time, with all graphs showing the same time range. Unless you’re using the HTTP interface to embed graphs in your own applications or web pages, this is the Graphite interface you’ll use most often. It’s certainly the interface that will be of most use to operations staff.

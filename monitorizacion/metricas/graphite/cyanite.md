Backend basado en Apache Cassandra

Cyanite is a metric storage daemon, exposing both a carbon listener and a simple web service. Its aim is to become a simple, scalable and drop-in replacement for graphite's backend.

Graphite is a powerful graphing solution. It sports a somewhat aged but very powerful web interface. Carbon is graphite's storage daemon, written in python which writes out whisper or ceres file.

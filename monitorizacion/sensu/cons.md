“Sensu has so many moving parts that I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night unless I set up a Nagios instance to make sure they were all running.”

(As a side note, yes all of our Nagios instances monitor each other, no they’ve never crashed)

I will be honest; I haven’t used Sensu, because I’m in a happy place right now, but just the architectural diagram of how it works scares the shit out of me. When you need 7 arrow colours to describe where data is going in a monitoring system, I’m starting to fear it slightly

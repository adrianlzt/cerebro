In short, Torrus is an alternative software platform to MRTG, Cricket and Cacti. In most cases it brings more flexibility and performance. We are able to poll 1 million SNMP OIDs every 5 minutes from a modern server.

Torrus is designed to be the universal data series processing framework. Its scalable hierarchical design, application-independent core, and highly customizable architecture make Torrus an attractive choice both for small installations and for big enterprise or carrier networks. Although most of our users deploy Torrus for SNMP monitoring, it might be useful for data series of any nature. Tobi Oetiker's RRDtool is used for data storage.

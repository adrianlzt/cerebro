Marvel’s overview dashboard provides full details on the health of your cluster, including cluster-wide metrics, overview of all nodes and indices and events such as master election or the addition of new nodes.

Marvel’s dedicated dashboards allow for in depth analysis of a wide collection of metrics, ranging from machine level information to details of Elasticsearch internals. Marvel also stores your historical data, allowing you to dive into past issues just as easily as you see your cluster’s performance in real-time.

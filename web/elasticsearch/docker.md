The images are available in three different configurations or "flavors". The basic flavor, which is the default, ships with X-Pack Basic features pre-installed and automatically activated with a free licence. The platinum flavor features all X-Pack functionally under a 30-day trial licence. The oss flavor does not include X-Pack, and contains only open-source Elasticsearch.

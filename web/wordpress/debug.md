Query Monitor. Query Monitor is great because it is very comprehensive. It can do a lot of stuff that other debugging plugins can’t, like auto Ajax debugging and the ability to filter results by specific plugin or theme. I use this plugin mostly for debugging database and query variables, but it also comes in handy for testing HTTP requests, WP hooks, PHP errors, and much more. Amazingly useful plugin that doesn’t receive the attention it deserves, imo.

Developer. Excellent if you need to take a closer look under the hood.

P3 (Plugin Performance Profiler). Good for getting a baseline on plugin performance.

SEOPressor. We already know how important SEO is. There are many SEO plugins but I found SEOPressor best. It shows keyword density of your keyword in WordPress editor. It shows over-optimization warning in case you have added extra tags, keywords, h1, h2, h3 tags. It also supports rich snippet. The best feature is LSI keyword. LSI keywords help you to find relevant keywords from your main keywords, using LSI keyword will make it easy for you to rank in Google.

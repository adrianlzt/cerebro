a vim like text editor

Vis aims to be a modern, legacy free, simple yet efficient vim-like editor.

It extends vim's modal editing with built-in support for multiple cursors/selections and combines it with sam's structural regular expression based command language.

As an universal editor it has decent Unicode support (including double width and combining characters) and should cope with arbitrary files including:
  large (up to a few Gigabytes) ones including
    Wikipedia/OpenStreetMap XML / SQL / CVS dumps
    amalgamated source trees (e.g. SQLite)
  single line ones e.g. minified JavaScript
  binary ones e.g. ELF files
